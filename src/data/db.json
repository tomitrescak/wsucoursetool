      "approachToLearning": "Expectations of Students\n\nStudents are expected to be familiar with and abide by the terms of the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Misconduct Rule. Students should also be familiar with the Work Health and Safety Policy at Western Sydney University.\n \nWorkplace Health and Safety\n\nThe Western Sydney University Work Health and Safety Policy states that it is the responsibility of employees, students, contractors, visitors and others to ensure this policy is carried out and to regard accident prevention and safe working as a collective and individual responsibility.\n \nAwareness and implementation of Workplace Health and Safety procedures is not only an important consideration to ensure the health and welfare of you and your colleagues, but is an integral component of all professional practice. Each unit may have safety inductions particular to that unit’s activities. Students will be required to complete any such inductions and meet requirements necessary to safely participate in that unit’s activities. Material regarding Workplace Health and Safety procedures for that unit will be available on the vUWS site for that unit.\n \nStudents should also be familiar with the Western Sydney University’s Work Health and Safety Policy which can be viewed at http://policies.uws.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00081 \n\nHow to raise concerns\n\nIf you have a concern about this unit, please contact your lecturer or tutor in the first instance. If the matter is not resolved, then you may contact the unit coordinator. If you would prefer to speak to someone else, you are advised to contact the Academic Course Advisor (ACA) or Director of Academic Program (DAP) of the School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics.\n \nThe University also has a confidential Complaints Resolution Unit (see link below). Staff in that unit can provide you with advice on addressing your concerns within the School and, in some circumstances, they may undertake an investigation. Concerns must be raised with the Complaints Resolution Unit  within a six month timeframe.\n\nGetting Help with Your Studies: Assistance with Academic Literacy\n\nWe take academic literacy very seriously at Western Sydney University. While tutors are happy to help we also expect you to take responsibility for developing your skills, particularly if you are struggling. There are many resources available within the unit and the University to help you. Resources on study skills, essay writing and referencing can be found via the fantastic Library Study Smart program, including face-to-face and online assistance), and on the Communication Academic Literacy site. The University also runs free online and face-to-face workshops. \n\nTo find out more please visit: http://www.hca.westernsydney.edu.au/cal/ \n\nHealth and Wellbeing \n\nIf you feel like you’re not coping during the semester due to stress, illness or other issues please make sure you discuss your concerns with someone. You can talk to your tutor, unit coordinator, course advisor or to a member of the University’s counselling services. The counselling team offers online, telephone and face-to-face appointments. The Communication Academic Literacy site also lists a number of resources for mental health and wellbeing. See http://www.hca.westernsydney.edu.au/cal/. \n\nStudent Workload \n\nThe expected workload in this unit is: 10 hours per week (for all 10 credit point units), including 2.5 hours in class and 6.5 hours in own study time. Lectures add an extra hour of class time for the first 7 weeks. Lectures during weeks 9-14 will be delivered via a series of short (7-12 min) video ‘lecture pods’ that students are expected to watch in their own time before coming to class. \n\nAttendance\n\nAttendance in lectures, tutorials and practicals is an essential part of academic success and engagement in all units in the Bachelor of Communication/Screen Media/Creative Industries and related double degrees. Students need to be aware of the issues and fine details of weekly content and assessment criteria, as they arise week-by-week. Students also informally learn from each other through social interaction and class group activities.\n \nTo ensure you have the best possible chance of success in your units, you are expected to attend 80% of classes – whether online or face-to-face. Please note that where attendance is critical to the completion of assessments, an attendance mark may be given as part of the overall assessment criteria for that assignment.\n \nAttendance records will be taken in all tutorials and practicals and you will be asked to explain if your attendance falls below the required minimum without explanation (for example, doctors’ certificates in the case of illness).",

One way to do this is to set up a mathematical model which we hope can provide insights, predictions and a greater understanding of a complex system. Selected real-world problems are approximated by mathematical models that are amenable to being written in terms of linear and non-linear equations or differential equations. Once equations are solved emphasis is placed on interpreting solutions, modifying models as required and using models for prediction.",

Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the  workload  will  be  somewhat  less.   It  will  be  essential  for  you  to  keep  up  with  the  assigned  core questions so that you are properly prepared for each assessment task.  Please do ask questions during  the  lectures,  this  is  the  most  effective  why  to  ensure  understanding  and  eliminate  miscomprehensions.  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textsf{Tutorial} & There  is  no  easy  way  to  learn  any  mathematics,  but  an  analogy  with  a  sport  like  tennis  holds:\nit looks easy when you see someone else do it, but doing it one’s self requires hours of practice.\nRead the definitions,  look at examples in the book and in class,  and then try doing it yourself,\nand  keep  trying  until  you  can  do  it  alone.  Talk  with  your  fellow  students  about  the  problems,\nnot  only  because  they  may  help  you,  but  you  may  help  them.   One  of  the  best  ways  to  learn\nsomething is to try to explain it to someone else.  Do tutorial problems, practice and then practice\nsome more.  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textsf{vUWS} & Complete  lecture  notes  will  be  provided  on  vUWS.

Students are welcomed to ask questions as this often\navoids misunderstanding. Lectures notes will sometimes be available from vUWS and students\nare expected to have read these notes at least once before the lecture. When no lecture notes\nare available, students should refer to appropriate section in the textbook. Students should also\nbring the recommended textbook to the lecture.\n \\\\\n  \\hline\nTutorial &amp;\nThere is a one (1) hour tutorial class each week where students have the opportunity to consolidate their understanding of the previous weeks lecture material. To pass this unit students should attend at least 80\\% of the tutorial sessions. Tutorial problems will be\nset each week and students will need to attempt to solve each of these problems before the\ntutorial class. This may require re-reading lecture notes or textbook, and/or looking at examples\nprovided in lectures and textbook. Students are expected to work individually but discussion\nwith fellow students is encouraged. By completing these tutorial questions you are preparing\nfor class tests and the final examination. In the tutorial class students may seek\nfurther guidance on understanding the theory and/or have solution to problems fully explained.\nThere will only be sufficient time to solve a few tutorial problems during the tutorial class, so\npreparation is essential if tutorials are going to be used effectively. The danger is time could be\nwasted going over problems that students would have been able to solve on their own if they\nhad done the required preparation, leaving no time for more difficult  problems. \\\\ \\hline\nvUWS &amp;\nThe following learning resources will be provided on vUWS for the unit: \\newline\n\\textit{Lecture notes:} Lecture notes with the worked examples omitted will be posted before\neach lecture, so that you don't have to copy down everything during the lectures and can focus\non listening instead. You should print out these notes, bring them to the lecture, and fill in the\nexamples during the lecture. \\newline\n\\textit{Tutorial exercises and worked solutions to these:} A sheet with tutorial questions will be\nposted one week before each tutorial. You should work through these questions before the\ntutorial and in the tutorial raise any problems you may have had. Complete worked solutions for\nall tutorial questions will be posted after each tutorial.\nDoing the tutorial questions and checking your own work against the worked solutions is the\nbest way of preparing for Class Tests and for the Final Exam. \\newline\n\\textit{Worked solutions to Class Tests:} Complete worked solutions for Class Tests will be posted after\neach Class Test. \\newline\n\\textit{Sample Exam:} A sample final exam paper will be posted before Stuvac. The main purpose of this paper is to give you a rough idea of the style of the questions which you should\nexpect in the exam. The selection of sample questions should not be taken as a hint regarding\nthe actual content of the exam. Do not base your exam preparation primarily on this (or any\nother) sample exam paper. Merely being able to reproduce solutions to sample exam questions\nwill not be sufficient to pass the Final Exam.\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}} &lt;/latex&gt;",

This is why the tutorial sheets contain many questions, enabling you to practice what is covered in lectures. There are many more questions than you can do in the tutorial. This is deliberate; it gives you extra questions to practice. The answers to the tutorial questions will be posted after the tutorial so that you can check what you have done. Test and exam questions are often inspired by tutorial questions. You should attempt all the tutorial questions before your tutorial. </p>\n<p>Information about the unit will be posted regularly on vUWS.

      "approachToLearning": "<p>This unit will require your full and continuous attention to achieve the highest possible grades. Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. It will be essential for you to keep up with the assigned core questions so that you are properly prepared for each assessment task. There is no easy way to learn any mathematics, but an analogy with a sport like tennis holds: it looks easy when you see someone else do it, but doing it ones self requires hours of practice. Read the definitions, look at examples in the book and in class, and then try doing exercises yourself, and keep trying until you can do them alone.\nTalk with your fellow students about the problems, not only because they may help you, but also you may help them. One of the best ways to learn something is to try to explain it to someone else. Do the tutorial problems, practise and then practise some more.\nAttendance is considered to be essential for successful completion of this unit. Students are expected to attend all lectures. The past statistics show that students who do not attend the lectures regularly account for a large proportion of those failing the unit. Students who miss lectures will need to read the appropriate sections in the textbook and/or obtain a copy of notes from a fellow student. Problem solving exercises at tutorials are compulsory and are an assessment component for the unit. Students who miss a tutorial due to misadventure (e.g., illness) must apply for special consideration in accordance with Western Sydney University policies within two (2) working days.</p>\n<p><u>Lecture:</u> Lectures are a three (3) hour class each week where information on each topic will be presented. Theory and examples will also be presented. Students are encouraged to ask questions as this often avoids misunderstanding. Lecture notes will be available from vUWS and students are expected to have read these notes at least once before the lecture. Students should also bring the recommended textbook to the lecture.</p>\n<p><u>Tutorial:</u> There is a one (1) hour tutorial class each week where students have the opportunity to consolidate their understanding of the previous or current week's lecture material. Tutorial problems will be set each week and students will need to attempt to solve each of these problems before the tutorial class. This may require re-reading lecture notes or textbook, and/or looking at examples provided in lectures and textbook. Students are expected to work individually but discussion with fellow students is encouraged. By completing these tutorial problems you are preparing for class tests and the final examination. In the tutorial class students may seek further guidance on understanding the theory and/or have solution to problems fully explained. There will only be sufficient time to solve a few tutorial problems during the tutorial class, so preparation is essential if tutorials are going to be used effectively.</p>",

Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. It will be essential for you to keep up with the tutorial questions so that you are properly prepared for each assessment task. There is no easy way to learn any mathematics, but an analogy with a sport like tennis holds: it looks easy when you see someone else do it, but doing it yourself requires hours of practice. Read the definitions, look at examples in the book and in class, and then try doing problems yourself, and keep trying until you can do them alone. Talk with your fellow students about the problems. Not only because they may help you, but you may help them. One of the best ways to learn something is to try to explain it to someone else. Do tutorial problems, practise and then practise some more.",

You will have a high risk of failing this unit if you have not previously passed 300673 Mathematics 1B. Advanced techniques of integration from Mathematics 1B are used from lecture 1 onwards, throughout the entire semester. If you have not passed 300673 Mathematics 1B you should seriously consider your enrolment in this unit. Approximately 90% of students without the appropriate background fail this unit. Contact the unit coordinator if you require further information.\n\nLectures are designed to provide you with the basic theoretical concepts in differential equations and related topics. They also address various applications and many worked examples. There are three hours of lectures each week. Tutorials will help students to reinforce the concepts and techniques which are introduced in the lectures. There is a one hour tutorial each week.\n\nLectures\nSkeleton lecture notes are placed on vUWS for students to print and bring to lecture classes. The essential theoretical ideas and illustrative examples are discussed in great detail. Students will have an opportunity to complete the skeleton notes during class. If you miss a lecture class, for any reason, you should refer to the text to help you complete the skeleton notes by yourself. Under no circumstances should you ask for a complete set of notes. It is strongly recommended that you attend all scheduled lectures to support your learning. In previous semesters, students with a poor attendance record often found themselves at risk of not passing the assessment tasks.\n\nTutorials\nThe tutorials are designed to reinforce the essential techniques to understand the unit content.

It also provides a sound base for more advanced study in statistics and forecasting in subsequent sessions. Topics include: presentation of data; descriptive statistics; the role of uncertainty in business decision making; hypothesis testing; and basic forecasting.",

      "approachToLearning": "The theory for each topic as well as examples will be presented in the online lecture. The online lectures have been broken into small sub topics. Students are expected to view each of the sub topic videos for the weekly topic. \n\nThis unit is one in which the later topics build on material covered earlier in the unit. As such, it is critical that students work consistently on this unit throughout the semester. Through the exams, it is intended to examine a student's understanding and ability to apply appropriate techniques rather than the ability to rote learn. \n\nIt is advised that students cover a topic each week as per the Teaching activities. Information will be put onto vUWS for both internal and external students (there will be a folder especially for the external class).  You are advised to look through all this material (not just that for the external class) as it will be helpful to you in progressing through this unit. \n\nThere will be a discussion board on the vUWS site just for the external class.  It is open to anyone to respond to the items that are placed there.  I will monitor the external class discussion board and add comments as necessary and appropriate.\n",

With the assistance of your supervisor, you will define the problem to be studied and then acquire, develop and/or apply the appropriate theory or methodology. The final report will consist of a presentation of analytical and/or theoretical results, analysis and discussion followed by an appropriate conclusion and a literature review or a list of references as appropriate.  You will give two oral presentations on your project.\n\nProjects will be done in groups of two students, so you will also gain experience and skills in working in a team.\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Plan and develop an investigative project\n2. Locate, identify and use information relevant to the problem being studied\n3. Undertake self-directed study relevant to the problem being investigated\n4. Undertake a theoretical and/or analytical investigation\n5. Write and produce a comprehensive research report in a logical, concise and professional manner\n6. Present a project and its results to an audience in a talk",

      "approachToLearning": "\nThis unit enhances learning through the following means:\n\n•\tThree hours of detailed lectures each week; theory, examples and various ideas are presented to the student;\n•\tA one hour tutorial each week; discussion of exercises;\n•\tFeedback on assignments and class tests, with solutions presented in vUWS for the student to review.\n\nFurthermore,  During the semester, students will prepare and present a solution to a tutorial question on the whiteboard in the class. This will help them to practice their presentation skills, as well as acquiring a deeper understanding of the subject. The Assignment is designed to provide an opportunity for solving problems without the pressure of time, to give feedback about students progress, and most importantly to help students learn the content of the unit.",

The goals of the unit are to introduce the study of numbers and consider their generalization to rings and fields, to introduce the concept of a group and present some major results related to groups, to develop skills in reading and writing mathematics (including proving theorems), and to explore an application to the RSA cryptosystem.\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Recognise, describe and manipulate the basic structures in abstract algebra and number theory; namely, groups, rings and integral domains\n2. Explain the links between these structures and the symmetries of natural objects\n3. Apply concepts from group theory and number theory to real life situations, such as RSA cryptography\n4. Demonstrate proficiency in both spoken and written mathematical communications, particularly constructing and communicating proofs",

      "description": "This unit is the first of two mathematics units to be completed by all students enrolled in an engineering degree during their first year of study. The content covers a number of topics that underpin the later-stage engineering mathematics units. The subject matter includes: differential and integral calculus of a single variable, complex numbers, aspects of matrix algebra, vectors, and some elementary statistics and probability theory. The aim of this unit is to introduce a number of key mathematical concepts needed in the study of Engineering, and to provide a solid foundation for the follow-on unit Mathematics for Engineers 2.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "HSC Mathematics achieved at band 5 or 6.  This is the minimum requirement.",
      "approachToLearning": "<p>This unit has been developed to provide many opportunities for students to develop their mathematical skills in a variety of areas and be challenged by new problems. Attending and engaging in the face-to-face lectures, listening to the lecture recordings and attending and engaging in tutorials is a vital first step in this gaining of knowledge. The mathematical content presented in the lectures and the tutorials provide the opportunity to unpack this content, practice the skills required and receive feedback on your progress.<br><br>Tutorial attendance is compulsory. <em><strong>Engaging in tutorials</strong></em> is also absolutely essential for student attainment of the unit learning outcomes. Attempt tutorial questions BEFORE class; and come ready to ask questions and seek any help required. You will achieve the maximum benefit from this unit only if you participate in the face to face sessions, complete all assessment tasks and practice IN YOUR OWN TIME outside of class time. This may mean changing your long-held attitudes and beliefs towards study and mathematics in general.<br><br>There are many online activities provided to further enhance your learning in this unit. All lectures will be available in written and spoken form online, usually within 24 hours of the scheduled lecture. The online quizzes are particularly useful in mapping your understanding of basic mathematical skills required in engineering. Feedback plays a critical role in assessing your progress; so you are very strongly encouraged to participate in all activities, and to make one-on-one appointments throughout the session with your lecturer and tutor to monitor your progress.<br><br>Historically this unit has quite a high failure rate each semester; and this is for the most part due to a lack of student engagement! If you do not wish to be one of these students, you are strongly encouraged to work hard at this unit. Attend ALL scheduled classes; work on the tutorial questions both in and out of class time; and utilise not only sample assessments and past papers but also tutorial problems and examples from lectures to study for all your assessments. If you ﬁnd you are struggling, you should also make use of all the free support services: PASS (Peer Assistance Study Scheme), MESH (Mathematics Education Support Hub) or you are also encouraged to seek help from your unit coordinator and/or the teaching staff during their consultation times. MESH provides free drop-in Maths &amp; Stats Help (for locations and times http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/meshroving), plus online help \"I Don't Get It'' (in the Improve Your Maths vUWS site) and unit specific test and exam preparation workshops (http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/mesh_events).</p>",

Listening to the pre-recorded material and engaging in the face–to–face sessions is a vital first step in this gaining of knowledge. The mathematical content presented in the lectures and the tutorials provide the opportunity to unpack this knowledge, practise the skills required and receive feedback on your progress. \n\n</p><p>Blended learning strategies are used in this unit. All lectures will be available in recorded and written form. The online quizzes are particularly useful in mapping your competency in achieving the outcomes of this unit. Feedback plays a critical role in assessing your progress so you are strongly encouraged to participate in all activities and to make one-on-one appointments throughout the session with your lecturer and tutor to monitor your progress.\n\n</p><p>With the blended learning format of this unit more responsibility is placed on the student to manage the time they allot to this unit. The pre-recorded lectures and worked examples must be listened to before coming to the face-to-face tutorial session. You will get the most out of the tutorial sessions if you are prepared. The face–to–face session is not for the tutor to work through questions but for you to enhance your learning by doing and participating in the class.\n\n</p><p>You will achieve the maximum benefit from this unit only if you participate in the face–to–face sessions and complete all assessment tasks and practise IN YOUR OWN TIME out of class. This may mean ch<latex></latex>anging your long-held attitudes/beliefs towards study and mathematics in general.<br>\n\n</p><p>Lecture: Students are expected to listen to a pre-recorded lecture session and to attend all lecture sessions. The face-to-face lectures will be a workshop style where comprehensive solutions for given questions will be worked through. These sessions will be recorded using Panopto.\n\n</p><p>Tutorial: Tutorial questions are attached to each set of lecture notes. It is expected that students will attempt these questions before coming to the tutorial session.\n\n</p><p>vUWS: Students are required to listen to a pre-recorded lecture (approximately 30-40 minutes) and do worked examples prior to each tutorial session. Students are required to attempt 6 online quizzes during the semester. All learning material for the unit is found on the vUWS site. Students are expected to check the unit's vUWS site regularly as all announcements will be made via vUWS and teaching material may be regularly updated and posted online. </p>",

      "approachToLearning": "<p>Biometry introduces students to various statistical techniques commonly required when engaging in the scientific method. Using the resource material provided in Worksheets and software demonstration videos, students will perform statistical analyses and interpret results using the software called R-commander. Students are provided practical data sets which some have been collected through experiments done in their other units. </p>\n<p>R-commander has been installed correctly and runs effectively in all WSU IT lab computers. Instructions on how to use R-commander in the WSU IT lab computers are provided on Biometry vUWS site. Students are very strongly advised to use the WSU IT lab computers when using R-commander. Please note that R-commander is NOT installed in Library computers nor in SCDMS labs ( i.e. former SCEM labs). Students are strongly advised to contact the unit coordinator if they have software issues and such issues need to be addressed well before online quizzes start.</p>\n<p><br>In Autumn 2020, this unit is offered as a Composite delivery (i.e. External delivery). Unit learning material will be available online via vUWS site. There will not be any face to face weekly lectures and practicals except the two optional workshops held at Hawkesbury campus. First workshop will be held during the mid-session break and the second is scheduled during StuVac. Biometry is a 10 credit point unit and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. It is expected that you will spend at least 10 hours per week for 14 weeks on this unit. For example, 2 hours for lectures , 2 hours for practicals and a further 6 hours per week could be spent on R-commander demonstration videos/online lectures and textbook readings/questions. Hence you are strongly encouraged to adhere to the schedule of Teaching and Learning Activities which can be found in the Learning Guide. This schedule sets out clearly what you should be doing each week. Please keep up-to-date with the content as set out in this schedule so that your attendance at workshops will be worthwhile and also give you the best possible chance of successfully completing 200263 Biometry over Autumn 2020.</p>",

      "approachToLearning": "This unit is a 10 credit point unit and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. It is expected that you will spend at least 10 hours each week (on average) which includes the four (4) face-to-face hours (lectures and tutorials/practicals) per week. Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. \n\nLectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Whilst attendance in lectures is not compulsory, it is highly recommended. All content covered in lectures is examinable. The lecture sets the context for the practical the following week and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination.\n\nPracticals/tutorials provide the opportunity for learning in a smaller class context. The practicals/tutorials are designed for further discussion of the theoretical concepts covered in lectures, as well as exploration of the practical concepts and samples involved in developing programs for computer graphics. Along with your lectures, the practicals/tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the final exam, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. The practicals/tutorials enables students to maintain adequate performance and continuity of their tutorial/practical program and tutors to maintain contact, monitor their students progress as well as provide verbal feedback of your work and understanding outside of formal assignment\nfeedback.\n\nStudents should access vUWS and/or check their student email account(s) at least twice a week for teaching materials, announcements and reading materials, documents and other information.",

This means that, provided you work efficiently in the face-to-face teaching/learning time, you will need to spend a minimum of an additional six (6) hours per week working on the material for this unit, including reading the online curriculum, preparation for the practical lab workshop exercises, completing online quizzes and studying for the final exam.\n\nIn this unit you will be engaged in a range of activities to support your learning. There are a range of resources available to assist you in this unit and university study more generally. The key activities and resources for this unit are outlined in section 3 of this learning guide.\n",

      "description": "This unit is designed for computer science students, particularly those interested in systems programming and hardware development. The students will learn about the interface between the hardware and software of a computer system. This will involve study of some aspects of computer architecture and low level interfacing to gain an insight into central processing unit (CPU) organisation at the assembly language level. After completing this unit students will be able to write procedures in an assembly language, use their understanding of the relationship between the instruction set architecture and the implementation of high level languages to write efficient programs.",
      "assumedKnowledge": null,
      "approachToLearning": "There are weekly face-to-face lectures to present related topics of the unit. The lectures and text reading will examine the theoretical aspects related to computer organisation and architecture. You are required to practice the topics by during tutorials for each module of the unit. The practical activities are designed to reinforce students’ understanding of theoretical concepts. In addition to lecture notes and laboratory worksheets, we may also provide some recorded lectures and online discussion to support the unit content so that you can practice further the presented concepts in your own time. Following this approach to learning, you will gain programming expertise in becoming a confident and competent system programmer and hardware developer.\n\nThis unit has been iteratively designed and implemented by following the key steps applying blended learning:\n\n•\tPlanning for integration of blended learning principles\n•\tDesigning the learning activities and assessment and developing them as required\n•\tImplementing the blended learning design\n•\tEvaluating the effectiveness of blended learning designs\n•\tMaking improvements for the next time of the unit delivery\n\nIt has been structured towards a blended delivery model, where the teaching activities consist of face-to-face lectures, some online-lecturing and on-campus practice. We’ll continue to revise the Blended Learning approach (e.g. implementing adaptable techniques and settings) to satisfy the needs for student-centered learning. This could be a long-run process.",

The material covered forms the basis for further studies in programming and software engineering in later units and for further training in programming skills. The unit focuses on the ideas of data abstraction and algorithm efficiency. The issues of computational complexity of algorithms are addressed throughout the semester. The topics covered include the fundamental abstract data types (lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs), recursion, complexity of algorithms, sorting and searching algorithms, binary search trees and graphs.",

      "outcome": "<p>This unit introduces students to fundamental data structures and algorithms used in computing. It follows introductory programming units, such as Programming Fundamentals and Object Oriented Programming, further to train students with professional programming skills. The material covered forms the basis for further studies in all computing related courses. The unit focuses on the ideas of data abstraction, issues related to data typing, and software reuse. The issues of computational complexity of algorithms are addressed throughout the semester. The topics covered include the fundamental abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, graphs, recursion, complexity of algorithms, internal and external sorting, searching algorithms, file structures, binary trees and B-trees. This unit assumes students have a working knowledge of programming in a language such as C, C++ or Java. Basic skills of programming as gained from the introductory units of programming such as Programming Fundamentals will be used. The students will have advantage in learning this unit if they have taken any level 2 or above programming units, such as Object Oriented Programming or Programming Techniques. Study of data structures can be challenging as both the concept of the structure, its implementation and coding must be understood. Students need to be thoroughly familiar with the concept of typing in computer languages as this can cause difficulties in implementing flexible data containers, which are able to hold different types of data. In this unit a particular approach using pointers is used. Thus an understanding of pointers is essential also to be successful in implementing the structures.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Select appropriate data structures to solve moderately complex programming problems\n2. Discuss time and space tradeoffs among different data structures that could be used to represent specific information\n3. Perform time-complexity analysis against multiple implementations of various abstract data types\n4. Write programs that use the fundamental abstract data types: linked list, stack, queue, hash table, binary search tree, heap, graph\n5. Select efficient sorting and searching algorithms to solve moderately complex programming problems",

      "description": "The main purpose of this unit is to provide students with an opportunity to gain a basic knowledge of database design and development including data modeling methods, techniques for database design using a set of business rules that are derived from a case study and finally implementation of the database using a commercial relational database management system. The unit also examines a number of important database concepts such as database administration, concurrency, backup and recovery and security. At the same time student learning and intercommunication skills are enhanced by running tutorial presentations and group assignments.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Basic programming skills, including variable declaration, variable assignment, selection statement and loop structure.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit enhances learning through the following means:\n\nLectures - all regular lecture notes are available on the unit website.  They contain the main points and key issues for the unit, and indicate the depth of understanding expected of the students.  As such, lecturers may choose to elaborate more on certain more important or fundamental concepts or  techniques  during  the  class  and  leave  the  uncovered  slides  to  be  studied  by  the  students themselves.  Some  lectures  will  also  contain  a  few  slides  at  the  end  on  the  SQL  statements  for the  completeness  of  the  notes;  they  are  in  general  expected  to  be  read  by  the  students  again, and briefly explained by the tutors during the tutorials/practicals on the need-to basis.\n\nTutorials/Practicals  -  provide  students  with  hands-on  experience  working  with  database  design and construction as well as effectively formulating queries in SQL. The tutorial part will discuss with the students some selected topics in more detail.  The combination of tutorials and practicals will  typically  consolidate  what  the  students  have  already  learned  in  the  previous  week/s,  with possibly  some  relevant  additional  materials  as  well,  and  will  provide  feedback  immediately  in class and in person whenever possible so that students are aware of their level of understanding of the material being presented.\n\nAssignments - two assignments are set to go through the main aspects of database design and development. The design process entailed by these assignments will go a long way at enhancing the students' profound understanding on the design and the use of database. Making queries in SQL is another skill to be gained by the students through these assignments.\n\nTextbook - the text provides additional detail and examples on top of what is in the lecture notes. Students should refer to it if in difficulty with a concept or technique, and should try to read through the relevant parts as much as possible.\n\nAdvanced Content - There are a variety of slides or practical paragraphs marked explicitly as advanced or optional. These are meant for the students of 300941, and will not be assessed in any way for the students of 300104, although they will help students a great deal in better understanding the topics in this unit.\n\nvUWS and External Portal - all announcements and teaching materials, including all assignments, are accessible via vUWS, as well as the External Portal outside vUWS. All submissions must be electronic and through the submission page on the unit website. Students are required to visit the unit website for the latest announcement on a regular basis.\n\nUnit 300104 will share the website with the unit 300941 - Database Design and Development (Advanced).",

      "outcome": "This unit assumes basic programming knowledge and skills. The practicals will be mostly based on Microsoft SQL Server for the database construction and queries. Microsoft Access will also be briefly utilized in the practicals. The unit learning outcomes are summarised in the table at the end of this subsection.\n\nThis unit promotes teamwork - the two major assignments can be done in a group of two.\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this unit. However, basic programming skills, including variable declaration, variable assignment, selection statement and loop structure, are the assumed knowledge.\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Describe components of a database system, advantages and disadvantages of a database system, roles peoples play and the historical development of a database system in the context of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)\n2. Apply basic skills in database modeling, including ER diagrams and normalization in RDBMS\n3. Explain the basic concepts of relational algebra and apply them in queries\n4. Describe the general concepts of transaction management\n5. Identify concepts in database administration\n6. Describe concepts in database security and backup\n7. Define and manipulate data using structured query language (SQL)\n8. Design and develop a database for a business application using a commercial database management system",

It builds on basic network communication protocols (specifically IP) to cover client server programming using both the system level socket interface and remote procedure calls. It also examines large scale distributed system architectures particularly those based on distributed objects and considers the complexities inherent in distributed transactions. Key concepts covered include data and algorithmic distribution, idempotent protocols, stateless and statefull servers, and distributed system transparency. Illustrative case studies are included.",

The weekly on-campus practicals start from week 2. On-campus students are required to attend tutorials. External students do not have to attend the on-campus tutorials except the PPT presentation and practical exam (unless alternative options are provided).\n</p>\n<p>\nIt has been structured towards a blended delivery model, where the teaching activities consist of online-lecturing and on-campus practice. We run this unit in a manner of \"small lecture but big tutorial\" and \"light presentation but heavy practical\". This model builds upon the nature of university study of being effective and independent learners.\n\nWe'll continue to revise the Blended Learning approach (e.g. implementing adaptable techniques and settings) to satisfy the needs for student-centered learning. This could be a long-run process.</p>",

Students also learn how to administer a LAN by setting up user accounts, access privileges, security procedures and back-up/recovery procedures.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Ability to list, discuss and compare the elements of information coding and signal transmission. List, describe and explain the elements and functional relationships of communications hardware and software. Identify, locate, distinguish and describe the individual hardware components of a personal computer (PC) and explain their purpose, functions and operations. Install PC components, devices and peripherals in accordance with installation procedures and operational standards.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit contains four hours of weekly face-to-face teaching components (a 2-hour lecture and a 2-hour workshop). Besides, students should spend at least 6 hours in self-study each week in the unit learning. The extra hours are to be used for reading lecture notes, preparing for practical exercises, taking online self-tests, completing the assignment and studying for quizzes and the final examination. \n\nAcademic activities carried out in the unit teaching/learning include lectures, workshops (practicals), self-tests, and the assignment (applied project). \n\nLectures\nLecture notes (and other teaching materials) will be made available at the unit website (vUWS) before the corresponding class commences. The material introduced in each lecture is to familiarise you with the key theoretic concepts of the unit and is usually contained and strengthened in the corresponding tutorial/ practical of the following week workshop. \n\nWorkshops\nTutorial questions and hands-on exercises are designed in the workshop session to consolidate what students have learnt in the lecture. The practical exercises, while closely related to the unit, some of the questions are designed to deepen the study of a particular topic that may not be directly included in the lecture notes. Students are welcome to discuss among themselves and search on-line resources during such exercise time. Please be advised that the workshop session is compulsory and the two quizzes will be conducted in the workshop time.\n\nSelf-Tests\t \nA large number of self-testing questions will be provided to help students to check their understanding at each stage of unit learning. Some of the test questions may not be covered by lecture notes and are designed to extend the scope of the unit.\n\nApplied Project\nShould be each student's individual work as an extension of the workshop exercises.

      "description": "The core strength of this unit is to analyse and model business objectives and critical requirements of software systems to be developed using object-oriented (OO) approaches. The system analysis is taken to greater depths within the context of Object Orientation. The Unified Modelling Language version 2.0 (notably use cases, user case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams) is used as the modelling standard for creating OO models in the problem space. The unit also covers the rational unified process methodology and applications of design patterns for software development through practical case studies.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "General understanding of what an information system is and how information systems development is undertaken and\n•\tIntroductory knowledge about system analysis and design, including \n- basic problem solving experience in computerised information systems\n- ability to derive systems requirements from problem definitions\n- ability to produce system models using process, data, object and network modelling.\n- understanding design and implementation issues include, (but may not be limited to), elementary database design, input, output and user interface design and prototyping.\n•\tGeneral knowledge on programming languages\n- Understanding difference between procedure programming  and object oriented programming   \n- Introductory knowledge of classes and objects and the class construction\n- Introductory knowledge on object orientation, including encapsulation, inheritance\n",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit is a 10 credit point unit (so need averagely 10-hour studying time per week)  and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. We will provide lecture notes, tutorials and reading materials to support the unit content so that you can practice further in your own time.\n\nAttendance at the tutorials/practicals (face-to-face activities) is compulsory. The participation  mark for each tutorial/practical class can only be achieved through attending the session.  Before each class you need read carefully the question sheet and start to work on some of them as the two hour tutorial time is usually not enough for completing all the exercises. Attendance at the lectures (face-to-face activities) is highly desirable as it will reflect students' participation, performance and understanding. You should go through the lecture notes before attending the class\n\nStudents should access vUWS and check their student email accounts at least  three times per week for announcements,  teaching materials, recommended readings, documents and other  relevant information.",

It addresses the importance of the separation of behaviour and implementation as well as effective use of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. The students will gain intensive training in programming skills with supervised laboratory sessions and task oriented assignments.",

      "approachToLearning": "TEACHING ACTIVITIES:\n- Two hours lecture per week, 13 lectures in total.\n- Two-hour compulsory practical session per week, ten practical sessions and three online tutorials in total.\n\nTo achieve all the learning outcomes, the students are required to attend all teaching activities. Attendance of practical sessions and attempt of online tutorials are compulsory. Each practical session is two hours, sitting in a three hours time slot.  Students work on practical tasks will be checked face-to-face by the tutors during the practical sessions. No email submission is acceptable. There is no practical class in Week 1 but an online survey is due at the end of the first week. \n\nTIPS OF LEARNING:\n- Attend all lectures, which are where you learn the theory of object-oriented programming.\n- Pay particular attention to the example code your lecturer demonstrates during each lecture. Download the code and run it offline.\n- Prepare your answer of practical tasks before you attend practical class. It will save your time.  Practice is most important for learning programming languages.\n- Watch out for the deadlines of the three online tutorials. They are important practice for multiple choice questions in the final examination. You cannot access online tutorials after their deadlines.\n- Object-oriented may not be the most intuitive way of programming but once you get used to it, it might be the simplest and most efficient way of programming.",

The unit focuses on the use of high level interpretive scripting languages to automate everyday administrative tasks, and to monitor and control running systems. Techniques to extend scripting language capabilities by dynamic linking to compiled code are examined, particularly in terms of access to operating system level functions. The unit also examines the use of administrative programs and tools to monitor and adjust system performance and capacity.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students should have a thorough grounding in systems programming and operating systems basics.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit has been restructured towards a new delivery model, where the teaching activities consist of online lecturing and on-campus hands-on practice. This model builds upon the nature of university studies - being effective and independent learners. \n\nThere are NO traditional face-to-face lectures in this unit. Lectures are in on-line format and hence no attendance is required for this component; you undertake a self-study of the lecture modules that present the major topics of this unit. The lectures and text reading will examine the key topics of your learning environment related to systems administration.\n\nThe practical activities are designed to reinforce students’ understanding of theoretical concepts and that you will gain programming expertise in becoming a confident and competent systems administrator. The weekly on-campus practicals start from week 2; each session is in three hours: ten minutes for quiz, fifty minutes for tutorial and the rest of two hours for practical tasks. Students are required to attend tutorials.\n\nWe’ll continue to revise the Blended Learning approach (e.g. implementing adaptable techniques and settings) to satisfy the needs for student-centered learning.",

The unit focuses on the use of high level interpretive scripting languages to automate everyday administrative tasks, monitor and control running systems, as well as adjust system performance and capacity. Students will learn scripting techniques through working on a set of common administrative tasks, from simple logon to automated system management. This unit also provides students with more training in understanding programming principles for studying other computing-related subjects.\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. List and define the key types of system administration tasks that are suitable for full or partial automation programmatically\n2. Select the most appropriate programming implementation method for a required system administration task from the range: shell scripts, scripting languages, and low level compiled languages; and explain the reasons for the selection\n3. Write, test and document system administration programs in a scripting language for various administration tasks that are synchronised or asynchronised (serial, parallel, or event driven) in nature\n4. Write programs to automate tasks like user management, software management, backup & recovery, and system security for both local (centralised) and distributed systems\n5. Extend the capabilities of a high level scripting language\n6. Explain the fundamental principles of performance and capacity planning in regards to systems administration\n7. Write programs to collect performance and capacity data for performance and capacity planning purposes. Explain the meaning and significance of the data collected, recommend system administration actions based on this interpretation, and write programs to implement the recommended actions\n8. Deliver tested and documented programs with significant complexity within specified project deadlines and in a form that meets IT professional standards",

      "description": "With the advent of the era of Internet of Things, the Internet has become a huge infrastructure in which various kinds of systems are running to deliver a plethora of network services. To ensure the efficient utilization of network resources (e.g., bandwidth) and the convenient access to network services, systems and networks must be managed in a proper way. Facing this demand, this unit covers the standards, protocols and skills pertinent to the management of systems and networks. Moreover, this unit introduces Software Defined Networking (SDN), a new paradigm for conducting network management with programmability, flexibility and scalability.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students should be familiar with the fundamentals of computer networking and data communications. In particular, they should have a good understanding of the TCP/IP protocol suite, the OSI model, and current networking and internetworking technologies.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit includes weekly lectures, practical classes and online activities on vUWS. The recommended approaches to these activities are given below. \n\nLectures: Lectures are designed to explain and demonstrate knowledge and skills related to system and network management. All knowledge and skills needed in tutorial questions and labs will be covered by lectures. Students are strongly encouraged to attend lectures.\n\nPractical classes: Each 2-hour practical class consists of roughly 0.5-hour tutorial discussion and 1.5-hour lab work. In the tutorial discussion, the tutor will discuss the online quiz questions with you. In the 1.5-hour lab work, you should complete practical exercises according to the lab instructions posted on vUWS. You can get help from tutors during lab work.\n      You should show your lab report to your tutor before the end of the lab. If you cannot finish within the lab, the only chance to be marked is in the next lab class; however, you will receive 50% late penalty for this if no extenuating circumstances are present. To prevent losing marks due to late completion, you should start working on labs before you enter lab classes.\n\nvUWS: Unit materials, including lecture slides, online quizzes and lab instructions, will be made available on the unit vUWS site. Also, all unit announcements will be made via vUWS. Therefore, you are expected to consult vUWS at least three times a week.",

      "description": "Wireless technologies are amongst the most exciting and rapidly growing areas in computing and information technology. They implement applications that profoundly impact our personal way of communication, as well as how business in a variety of industries and organisations are conducted. This unit goes into details of such issues. It discusses wireless networking technologies and their related applications. The main features of wireless and mobile communication systems and the networked services that are based on these systems are also presented. The unit provides students with an in-depth understanding of relevant protocols, the emerging standards and standard organisations. The students are also introduced to some of the relevant current key research issues of the field.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students should be familiar with the fundamentals of computer networking and data communications. In particular, they should have a good understanding of the OSI model, the Internet protocol suite and current internet and networking technologies equivalent to satisfactory completion of an introductory networking unit at the undergraduate level such as 300086 offered at Western Sydney University or one year professional experience in networking. The unit is at an advanced level and students would not be able to complete the unit successfully unless they have a good understanding of fundamental issues in computer networking, Internet protocol suite and Internet technologies.",
      "approachToLearning": "The unit includes lively discussions. The students are highly encouraged to attend all classes, which may include assessable tasks, including quizzes. The marked quizzes will be returned to the students quickly, generally in the following class, to facilitate further discussions of the unit material. Students with any problems, concerns\n or doubts should discuss them with the unit coordinator as early as they can.\n",

      "description": "Today organizations extensively rely on web based information systems to market, sell, manage customer relations, and for most of the internal operations. Users are increasingly using mobile devices to interact with this information. Due to rapidly changing business environment these systems need to be designed in away to accommodate the frequent changes. New technologies and frameworks have been developed to support development of large, complex, mobile based, maintainable and evolutionary web systems. In this unit students will study some of these technologies, design methods and frameworks that can be successfully used to engineer such web systems. They will get hands on experience by developing such a system.",

      "approachToLearning": "In this unit, you will be engaged in a range of activities to support your learning. There are many resources available to assist you in this unit and university study more generally. The key activities and resources for this unit are outlined below. Learning materials for all the units will be accessible to enrolled students by login to the WSU online learning site ‘vUWS'. Copies of the lecture slides and audio/video recordings of the lectures will also be posted there, normally within 24 hrs of the lecture. Announcements and discussions on the units will also be placed on the vUWS site from time to time, and you should consult the site often so that you are aware of these. Failure to stay up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse.\n\nInteraction with the unit coordinator at their scheduled consultation times each week is possible for online mode students in person or by e-mail, telephone contact, or skype (by arrangement). \n\nOnline Students\nAll information and material relating to this unit will be available on vUWS. This unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and online. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to all sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment work tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for all sub-groups.\n\nOnline mode students will be required to take any final exam scheduled in a unit at the same time as the on-campus mode students. Arrangements for online mode students to write final exams in these units will be announced close to the end of the semester after the official exam schedule becomes available.\n\nPlease feel free to contact the unit coordinator at any time, should you be experiencing difficulties or have any queries or comments about any unit: we would like to offer you any extra support necessary as an external/online mode student.",

IT graduates must develop a mind set that recognises the importance of users and organisational contexts. They must employ user centered methodologies in the development, evaluation, and deployment of IT applications and systems. This unit examines human-computer interaction in order to develop and evaluate software, websites and information systems that not only look professional but are usable, functional and accessible.",

Indicate ways in which users' characteristics (i.e., age, education, cultural differences, disability etc.) require adaptation of a user interface to increase effectiveness.\n3. Integrate appropriate user-centred design methodologies into the development of an application or website and recognise advantages and disadvantages of doing so.\n4. Describe major usability guidelines and standards, for e.g. ISO or Nielsen.\n5. Develop both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes and produce user interfaces for domain specific applications.\n6. Create an appropriate user evaluation plan with carefully chosen subjective and objective measures.\n7. Discuss state of the art research issues and novel interaction technologies under the umbrella of HCI.",

This is the only face-to-face component of this unit. During the lectures the learning material is presented and discussed, along with announcements regarding assessment and administrative issues. If you miss a lecture it is advised you go through the lecture notes in your own time, and ensure you listen to the recording. If there is a lack of understanding the consultation hours provided by the teaching team should be utilised. It is the responsibility of the student to facilitate a way to catch up on material they have missed because of lack of attendance. The lectures and readings will examine the theoretical aspects related to the three content modules in this unit: (1) Ethics and Professional Code of Conduct, (2) Project Management, and (3) Legal, Social, Environmental issues, Quality Assurance and IT Compliance. The group project and independent learning activities in this unit are designed for you to further research and explore\nthe topics and issues introduced in the weekly lectures, as well as consolidate knowledge from earlier units</p><p><b>vUWS:</b>\n<br>You are expected to consult vUWS at least twice a week:<br>- Access learning and assessment material <br>- Submit assessments and receive assessment feedback<br>- Collaborate on the group project <br>- Check for messages from the teaching team</p>",

      "approachToLearning": "What is expected of you?\n\nThis unit is a 10-credit point unit. It is expected that you spend 10 hours each week working on this unit. The face-to- face component of this unit is a two (2) hour lectures each week and a two (2) hour practicals each week. This means that, provided you work efficiently in the face-to-face teaching/learning time, you are expected to spend an additional 6 hours each week working on material for this subject, including reading the textbook and other references, undertaking tutorial/homework exercises, working on assignments, reviewing lecture material, reflecting on your learning and preparing for the final exam.\n\nIn this unit you will be engaged in a range of activities to support your learning. There are many resources available to assist you in this unit and university study more generally. The key activities and resources for this unit are outlined below.\n\nAttendance\n\nAs this is the foundational programming unit and is required as a pre-requisite to subsequent units - attendance is strongly recommended for all lectures and practical sessions.\n\nLectures\n\nLectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Each lecture will set the context for the tutorial to follow and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination. Attendance in lectures is not compulsory, but is strongly recommended. Based on the previous experience, lecture attendance has a direct correlation with the exam marks of the students, as attending the lectures significantly improves understanding of the covered material. All content covered in the lectures is examinable.\n\nLectures provide strong theoretical foundations to develop understanding of the programming concepts and problem solving through coding. They contribute to learning outcomes 1-5.\n\nTutorials/Practicals\n\nTutorial classes provide an opportunity for learning in a more hands-on and interactive setting and focus on solving a set of practical programming problems. The term practical represents a document containing a list of practical problems for students to solve before the due date specified in this document. The tutorial class is solely dedicated to helping students with their practicals and the major assignment. Practical exercises will mainly provide students with hands-on experience working with data types, input and output, conditional statements, variables, loops, function construction and calling, as well as the use of arrays. These exercises will require the students to tackle various common problems during development and implementation of a typical application program. Most exercises are designed for learning and practicing, and the solution or hints will mostly be discussed during the tutorial classes.\n\nPracticals help to develop the necessary practical training and complement lectures through training students to independently apply the knowledge covered in the class to a range of new problems. They contribute to learning outcomes 1-5.\n\nOnline Learning\n\nOnline learning is supported through the vUWS platform as well as the Clara Online website. All lecture notes, video recordings, sample problems covered in the class and their solutions are provided online. All the practicals, marking and feedback are provided online. Online learning also contributes to learning outcomes 1-5.\n\nStudents should access the Programming Fundamentals vUWS site and check their stu- dent email account at least four times a week. Access to the units vUWS site is only available to students who are enrolled in the unit. Student enrolment can be cancelled for failure to meet financial obligations to the University, e.g. failure to pay library fines. If you do not have access or find that access is lost, you should contact the Student Centre to check enrolment.",

      "outcome": "As a first unit in computer programming, Programming Fundamentals teaches the basics of developing software with an emphasis on procedural programming. You will learn about basic data structures, concept of algorithms, fundamental programming constructs, common programming language features and functions, program design and good programming style. A high level programming language is combined with a highly visual framework to teach problem solving using software.\n\nThe art of programming is complex. It requires the exercise of several different skills. It is at the same time analytical and synthetic. It demands both precision and imagination. The written form of a program must be suitable for consumption by both computers and humans. Program writing is similar in some ways to the composition of music commissioned for a specific purpose and just as a sheet of music is effectively a set of commands to a musician, so too a program is a set of instructions to a computer.\n\nProgramming is a special kind of reasoning. To become a programmer requires significant amount of practice in designing and in analysing programs. So although programming goes on in your head and is mostly thinking, learning to program means spending a lot of time practicing to gain fluency and experience.\n\nWhen learning your first programming language, it is easy to get the impression that the hardest part of solving a problem on a computer is translating your ideas into the specific language that will be fed into the computer. This is definitely not the case. The most difficult part of solving a problem on a computer is coming up with the method of solution. After you have developed a method of solution, it is routine to translate your method into the required language; be it Java or any other programming language. When solving a problem with a computer, it is therefore helpful to temporarily ignore the language and to concentrate instead on formulating the steps of the solution and write them down in plain English, as if the instructions were to be given to a human being. A set of instructions expressed in this way is frequently referred to as an algorithm.\n\nReading a book or listening to lectures is not enough to make you a programmer. In order to learn programming you must practice. Reading textbooks should make the ideas plausible to you. That is the first stage of your learning, and the one, which requires the least effort. The second stage of understanding is to be able to follow other peoples’ reasoning.\n\nProgramming must be creative, but nobody can teach you creativity. You can learn it but only if you work at it consistently. Practice and more practice is what you will need. One of the difficulties you may face - and overcome - arises from the need for precision and the need for simplicity when writing programs. The need for precision makes some programs large, but even the largest program must be kept simple enough to understand. The most effective way to keep a program simple is to make it out of a small number of pieces, joined together to form one of the standard programming structures. Understanding a program that is constructed in this way is a matter of understanding its various components separately and then understanding the way they fit together.\n\nNo pre-requites are required for this unit.\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. With a chosen programming language in mind , analyse a given problem and from a simple problem description, identify desired inputs, outputs, and the necessary processing operations to convert input into output\n2. Develop an algorithm that applies structured programming techniques that solve the given problem\n3. Choose suitable data types to store relevant data for the given problem\n4. Design and code programs which use standard programming concepts: variables, sequence, loops, decision making constructs, mathematical and boolean operators, as well as functions\n5. Apply top-down modular design principles to programming problems and implement the solution using the chosen programming language",

      "description": "This unit is intended as a second unit of study in programming. It builds on a basic understanding of procedural programming as would be developed in a first unit. This unit continues the development of programming skills and methodologies required for professional programming and for further study in later computing units. Topics covered include multi-dimensional arrays, file I/O, searching and sorting, and an introduction to object-oriented programming involving classes and inheritance.",

      "approachToLearning": "It is important that students engage in, and take responsibility for, their learning. However, there are a number of useful learning aides that are available in this unit to help students succeed. These include, but are not limited to, Lectures, Practical classes, PASS, MyProgrammingLab, and Assessments. You may find any number of them useful during the semester.\n<latex>\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions)}\n\\\\\nPeer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) are free, weekly ‘super-group’ learning sessions. PASS is facilitated by senior students who have successfully completed the unit before. During the sessions you will meet and work collaboratively with other students from Programming Techniques to understand the unit content and develop study strategies to help improve your academic performance.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nSome students find this unit challenging, and PASS has a strong record of helping all students to excel. PASS sessions are available both face to face on campus and online, offering you more opportunities to achieve more together with PASS! To see the PASS timetable visit westernsydney.edu.au/pass\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Assessments}\n\\\\\nThe assessments in this unit are sets of practical exercises (Practical Sets), a Programming Project, and a Practical Programming Test.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA selection of the weekly practical exercises will be assessable. These exercises are assessable to encourage students to develop their problem solving and programming skills throughout the entire semester rather than just prior to a major assessment falling due; this cannot be emphasised enough since development of good programming skills needs regular practice. Practical exercises are an important aspect of the learning and assessment in this unit since they provide the necessary building blocks of practical programming skills. Students will develop these skills by completing two sets of practical exercises during the semester. As part of the development of the solutions to these practical exercises students will be required to briefly demonstrate their practical exercises to their tutor in class one (1) week before the assessment is due; this is known as a checkpoint; checkpoints are explained in detail in section 2.5.1 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe problem solving and programming skills obtained through lectures, tutorial and practical exercises, use of MyProgrammingLab and appropriate reading will be expanded and applied to a more in-depth programming project that is due toward the end of semester. Hence, it is important that students apply themselves to the smaller practical exercises to be able to pick up the skills needed to solve this more complex problem. More details on the programming project are found in section 2.5.2 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nBeing a very practically oriented unit there is no final written examination at the end of session. Instead, one partial-open-book practical programming test will be run during session that will assess various problem solving and programming skills in a controlled invigilated environment. More details on the practical programming test are found in section 2.5.3 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{MyProgrammingLab}\n\\\\\nMyProgrammingLab is a website provided by the publisher of the textbook. The website contains extra exercises relating to each of the textbook chapters and is of particular use for students that need extra drill exercises to aid their understanding. The UI of the website enables students to solve simple programming tasks online without the need for a compiler and will provide immediate personalised feedback on each exercise attempted. Details about how to register in MyProgrammingLab will be provided in a separate document at the start of semester in vUWS (Registration will only be possible if you have a valid access code which comes with the textbook Value Pack or may be purchased separately). \n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Note:} the use of MyProgrammingLab is not a requirement of any of the assessments of this unit and so its use is purely optional but may benefit some students to assist their learning through further exposure to programming problems.\n</latex>",

Lectures will provide students with an understanding of the material covered at a level that is not possible to attain through mere reading of resources alone.\nTwo hours of lecture will be held each week. Lecture slides are downloadable from vUWS on a weekly basis; bring a copy along to the lecture each week to annotate to make review of the notes more beneficial. Also read the relevant chapter from the textbook before attending the lecture each week.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Practicals}\\\\\nThis unit is very 'hands-on'; during practicals, students will be exposed to many skills that are best learnt by doing. During practicals, students work at their own pace, but need to meet the deadlines for submission of their practical work. The practicals also include checkpoints, in which students show their work-in-progress to their tutor, who will mark the work.\\\\\n\\\\\nBeing a very practically-oriented unit, there is no final written examination at the end of the semester. Instead, a restricted open book practical quiz will be run during a practical session which will assess various coding and other technical skills in a controlled environment.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{vUWS}\\\\\nAll lecture slides, code samples, and the specifications for the practical exercises and the major Web Application Assignment will be available on vUWS. The marking for the practical exercises and the assignment will also be conducted via rubrics on vUWS.\n</latex>",

      "approachToLearning": "This unit involves face-to-face lectures and practical classes. The recommended approaches to these activities are given below. \n\nLectures: Lectures aim to explain and demonstrate knowledge and skills in ASP.NET Core programming. Lectures cover or provide references to everything needed in completing practical sets and unit project, so students are strongly encouraged to attend lectures.\n\nPractical classes: Practical classes allow students to put their learning into practice by doing practical programming exercises. Tutors are available in practical classes to help students. To gain full benefit of the practical classes, students should study the lecture materials thoroughly and attempt the practical assignments prior to the classes and then seek help from tutors. It will be impossible for students to complete the practical assignments without prior preparation.\n\nvUWS: Lecture materials (slides and sample codes) and assignment specifications will be made available on vUWS. Also, unit announcements are posted on vUWS regularly. Moreover, practical assignments are submitted via vUWS. Therefore, students are expected to visit vUWS at least three times a week.",

Students without this assumed knowledge are advised to drop 300672 Mathematics 1A and instead study 300830 Analysis of Change (or study HSC calculus guides) to prepare for the next offering of 300672 Mathematics 1A.\n\nIt should be noted that students may complete the three units Quantitative Thinking, Analysis of Change and Mathematics 1A in the following order: (1) 300831 Quantitative Thinking, (2) 300830 Analysis of Change (3) 300672 Mathematics 1A. This means that students may complete 300831 before attempting 300830, but not after. Also 300830 and 300831 may be attempted before 300672, but not after. Students may not enrol in 300831 and 300830 or 300831 and 300672 or 300831 and 300672 in the same teaching semester.\n\nUpon successfully completing this unit, students will be able to:\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Define and operate with complex numbers\n2. Define and manipulate the following functions: exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic, inverse trig and inverse hyperbolic\n3. Find limits of functions and determine if a function is continuous or differentiable\n4. Find the derivatives of functions\n5. Apply correctly techniques of differential calculus to problems involving optimization, curve sketching and rates of change\n6. Calculate basic integrals",

You are strongly encouraged to adhere to the Learning Planner which can be found on vUWS. This Learning Planner sets out clearly what you should be doing each week. Please keep up-to-date with the content as set out in this Learning Planner, to give yourself the best possible chance of successfully completing 300673 Mathematics 1B.\n\nThere will be four individual written assignments and a final examination in this offering. The assignments are designed firstly to gauge your achievement and performance in relation to the unit learning outcomes and secondly to relate the concepts of this unit to deeper theory and/or applications. There will be practice tests and a sample examination to provide excellent preparation for the final examination, which is a summative examination. The mode of delivering this Autumn offering involves access to full lecture material and tutorial questions (with solutions) provided on vUWS. Students are strongly encouraged to discuss the content (see consultation times above) of this unit with the lecturer/tutor to assist in sorting out any problems that you may be experiencing.",

It focuses on the web page and site design, markup languages, client-side technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and Javascript, as well as server-side technologies such as web servers, database connectivity, and server side scripting. It also includes the use of multi-media, security, access rights, and the exploration of some of the latest technological wonders populated on the Internet. This unit is heavily orientated towards practical experience based on amplifying the theoretical concepts.",

They  contain  the main  points  and  key  issues  for  the  unit,  and  indicate  the  depth  of  understanding  expected  of the  students.   As  this  unit  is  more  lab  intensive  and  doesn’t  have  a  formal  textbook,  students are  expected  to  consolidate  and  extend  their  knowledge  and  skills  by  working  through  all  the practical  work  available  at  the  unit  website,  and  by  further  reading  the  relevant  materials elsewhere such as those recommended reference books.\n\nTutorial   Practicals   -   provide   students   with   intensive   hands-on   experience   on   the   website development.   These  practical  exercises  will  drill  the  students  systematically  for  the  prominent web  development  technologies  and  skills.   Students  are  required  to  complete  all  the  practical exercises distributed on the weekly basis on the unit website, and have these exercises completed in  the  students’  own  time  if  not  already  done  so  during  the  pertinent  classes.   The  instructor will also provide feedback immediately in class and in person whenever possible so that students are aware of their level of understanding as well as their progress on the unit as a whole.",

      "description": "The information and communications technologies are advancing at an ever-increasing rate. The whole world is now interconnected. The World Wide Web community is actively engaged in developing the next generation of the Web. Social networking on the Internet is facilitated by the latest developments such as Facebook, YouTube and MySpace. Artificial Intelligence is increasingly intertwined with the decisions we make every day. Large scale storage technologies are leading to Cloud Computing where data and applications may reside anywhere in the world. Research in how to access meaningful data from the vast amounts on the Web has led to initiatives such as Semantic Web and Linked Data. Mashups mix data from disparate sources to enable users to work more efficiently. Wireless and mobile computing are changing the market place. All of these trends are still in their early stages. To make sense of all these developments, the top echelons of the World Wide Web Consortium are actively engaged in creating a new discipline called Web Science. Advanced Topics in ICT will enable the students to appreciate the scale of new developments and create prototypes of applications in their desired ambit. This unit consists of three Topics selected each semester. Assessment will be by a series of discussion paper assignments here students will show they have met the unit learning outcomes.",

During each of the next three segments, you will receive a lecture from either an industry speaker or academic, doing state-of-the-art research in one of the ICT areas. Lectures last 2 x 2 hours, and you will be exposed to a general overview as well as specifics of interest of a given lecturer. </p><p>Then, you will be asked to write a report in one of the topics, covering general scientific reviews, literature reviews as well as measuring the social impact of given ICT field analysing scientific and popular resources. This will improve your knowledge of advanced topics in ICT, improve analytical and critical thinking as well as your literacy and writing skills. </p><p>Moreover, you are asked to attend school seminars to understand the format and flow of academic and scientific presentations. You will use the observed skills to do a presentation yourself in the three-minute thesis format, reporting on your findings and discussing possible approaches with your lecturer.<br></p>",

      "description": "Computer networking is one of the fastest growing technologies of our time. The Internet interconnects billions of computers providing many new exciting opportunities and challenges. The Internet and the World Wide Web have provided the communication and infrastructure needed for global collaboration and information exchange. As a result of the rapid growth of networked systems and the diverse applications that run on them, success in many professions depends on a sound understanding of the technologies underlying these systems and applications. This unit explores these issues and provides the students with such an understanding. It covers the principles and current practices pertinent to computer networking and communications. It describes some of the important technologies and devices used in modern networks for information distribution and data sharing. The unit helps the students to understand important models, protocols and standards in networking and internetworking.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students should be familiar with the fundamentals of computer architecture and programming principles. They should also have a working knowledge of the World Wide Web.",
      "approachToLearning": "The approach to learning in this unit is shaped by the aim of motivating students’ interests in different areas of computer networking and to prepare them for further studies in the field. This unit contains 13 two-hour long lectures and 12 two-hour long practical sessions. All of these sessions include discussions and exercises with other students and the lecturer or tutor. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in discussions and exercises as well as provide an ongoing feedback on their progress to the lecturer. The feedback can be provided verbally during the class or during consultations or through e-mail. Online and library research is an important component of learning experience for this unit.\n\nAttending and paying attention during lectures as well as reviewing lecture notes and study questions will help students understand complex concept such as networking layers and absorb and retain knowledge on function of different networking protocols. The discussions and exercises will facilitate students with acquiring ability to concisely explain technical aspects of the protocols as well as successfully solve various calculation based and subnetting problems. Finally, the practicals will provide opportunity for students to transform theoretical knowledge into hands-on experience of setting up networking devices as well as generate and analyse networking traffic with Wireshark software and in that way directly experience functioning of TCP/IP protocols in different layers.\n\nThe unit’s website available on vUWS is an essential part of this unit. It provides students with the access to most of the learning materials such as this study guide, lecture notes, study questions, exercises, videos of solved exercises, assessment examples, detailed assignment instructions as well as multimedia resources such as videos that provide background on concepts covered during lectures/tutorials and audio files of David Frazier’s lectures for “Fundamentals of Networking”.",

They are followed by lectures on security problems and\nsolutions in some common application and networking environments. Existing security solutions\nas well as some latest security techniques are also introduced in some of the lecture topics. All\nlecture materials are also supported by more in-depth written exercises. Some lecture materials\nare supported by practicals.\n\nPractical:\nPracticals serve as a platform for the students to increase their understanding of the acquired\nknowledge through some hand-on practical tasks. Real-time feedbacks will be given to the\nstudents on practical exercises during the practical sessions.\n",

An operating system defines an abstraction of hardware behavior and provides a range of services more suitable for ICT application development than what raw hardware could deliver, in terms of convenience, efficiency and security. It is important that ICT Professionals have some understanding of how these services are realized. For ICT Professionals whose role includes supporting the operating system this unit provides the introduction to the relevant theory and practice.",

Moreover, all lectures will be recorded and uploaded to vUWS. – Please note that <b>these online resources are meant to aid revision; ONLINE RESOURCES CANNOT REPLACE FACE TO FACE TIME during the weekly lecture and workshop classes</b>.   Active participation in lectures and workshops is crucial for mastering the learning outcomes:  Records from previous years show that <b>poor attendance in lectures and workshops is highly correlated with failing the unit</b>.  We cannot prevent you from ignoring this advice and choosing not to attend classes, but in this case, please don't blame the teaching team if you fail the unit:  The members of the teaching team are there to help you achieve the learning outcomes and succeed in this unit, but you need to make use of this offer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><b>Lectures</b>\n\n</p>\n<p>Mathematics/statistics is not a collection of recipes and formulae which you rote-learn \"because the teacher says so\"; the very reason why mathematics and statistics are powerful is that they <b>prove</b> that the methods they use are correct.</p>\n<p>While this unit is too short to give rigorous proofs for the correctness of the techniques you will see, it is crucial that you know <b>why</b> and <b>when</b> a statistical method works; only then can you decide whether it is applicable to a situation in which you're interested.   Moreover, understanding the reasons behind the techniques helps remember them.</p>\n<p>The objective of the lectures is to explain both, <b>how</b> a statistical technique is used, and <b>why/when</b> it works.</p>\n<p>Some students, especially those who did no mathematics or only a lower level of mathematics at high school, may find parts of the lectures somewhat intimidating.  If you find that this applies to you:<b> DON'T PANIC!</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will <b>not</b> be tested on proofs as such.</li>\n<li>You may find the explanations from the textbook more accessible; this is perfectly OK:  Textbook and lectures complement each other in that they use slightly different approaches to the material, but both cover the entire assessable content.  (The rationale for this is that seeing things twice from different angles should make it easier for many students.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><b>Workshops</b></p>\n<p>Understanding how and why a method works is the first step; being able to apply it in practice is the second.</p>\n<p>The workshops have a tutorial and a practical component.   The former will reinforce the \"how and why\" behind the methods we teach you; the latter will give you the opportunity to use them in practice:  We use the powerful open source statistics software R for teaching; it is a standard for professional statisticians all over the world.</p>\n<p>Short tasks conducted during the workshops every week starting in Week 3 form part of the assessment for the unit.</p>\n<p><b>STUDENTS CAN ONLY ATTEND THE WORKSHOP CLASS FOR WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED.</b></p>",

In the face-to-face sessions (lectures and tutorials), you will have the opportunity to learn and practice new skills. You will also receive feedback on your progress in these sessions. Feedback plays a critical role in assessing your progress; therefore, you are strongly encouraged to participate in all activities which may include on-line activities, as well as the face-to-face sessions. You are also strongly encouraged to make one-on-one appointments throughout the session with your lecturer and tutor, to monitor your progress.\n\n</p><p>This unit will emphasise the following areas that will help you meet the challenges that studying mathematics at university presents:\n</p><ol><li>Identify your particular learning style and the study strategies that complement your style.\n</li><li>Enhance your knowledge of mathematical concepts while building your confidence in your mathematical ability.</li></ol><p>However, you will achieve the maximum benefit from this unit only if you put these strategies into practice in your own time, out of class. This may mean cha<latex></latex>nging your long-held attitudes/beliefs towards study and mathematics in general. You will find material about these topics on the vUWS site, under the How to study mathematics tab. The content of this unit is presented via a two-hour lecture and a one-hour tutorial. There is also a one-hour time-slot in which class tests, workshops, or problem-solving sessions are held. More information is available from the Schedule of Teaching Activities.\n\n</p><p>You should attempt ALL of the activities listed in the Learning Planner. All of the activities in the Learning Planner are designed to enable you to achieve the learning outcomes at various times throughout the session. These activities vary, some are face-to-face (lectures and tutorials), others are drill and practice (self-test and online quizzes), and some are designed to prepare you for the content to be presented (Preparation) with the Review section designed so that you can check your understanding of the material presented each week. The Additional Material aims at providing further help with the content if you need further assistance. All of these activities should be attempted each week, so that you give yourself the best possible chance of successfully completing this unit.</p>",

Section 1 will enable students to get a good understanding of different types of testing, the entire life cycle of Testing; how to design and prepare Test Cases, Test Data, execute these Test Cases and manage the defects. Students will also learn the importance of exclusive Test Environment for Testing and how to create a Traceability Matrix relating Requirements to Test Cases. Since approaches to testing software have also evolved with rigorous systematic approaches and advanced tools to automate some of the testing tasks. Section 2 will expose students to Test Automation using an automation tool, Object mapping and repository creation, Exception handling, logging and reporting, and Creation and Execution of Automation scripts.",

      "description": "This Level 1 unit introduces students to the mathematical modelling techniques that are used to formulate and solve problems in the physical and biological sciences. To use these techniques successfully, students must develop the ability to formulate a problem mathematically and then be able to use the appropriate knowledge to test conclusions by analytical and numerical means. These skills will be emphasized as each technique in introduced. Apart from some introductory work on logarithms and exponentials (essential concepts in the sciences), the main techniques developed involve aspects of differential calculus, culminating in the use of differential equations to model real phenomena in the sciences.",

      "approachToLearning": "This unit has been developed to provide many opportunities for you to gain confidence (and knowledge) in your pursuit of the study of mathematics. You will gain this confidence and knowledge by reading through all the lecture material, attempting all the tutorial questions and online activities. While some of the content is strictly mathematical, a good number of the exercises and examples given show how the mathematics is used in a computational or scientific context. Transferring your mathematical knowledge into a scientific context can be very difficult; hence a variety of methods (reading material, practice questions, etc.) have been provided to help you achieve this goal.\n\nBe sure to keep up-to-date as it is very tempting to miss doing some work each week, believing that you can catch-up later. This rarely happens and, before you know it, the semester is drawing to a close! The skills you will learn in this unit will prepare you for solving scientific problems and, conversely, you will be able to take a scientific problem and extract the mathematics from it. You will receive feedback on your progress via your class tests, and you are strongly encouraged to contact your lecturer, Dr Brent Le Cornu (brent.lecornu@westernsydney.edu.au), at any time regarding your progress. Feedback plays a critical role in assessing your progress so you are strongly encouraged to participate in all activities\n\n <latex> {\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|p{14cm}|}\n\\hline\n\\rowcolor{gray!40!white}\n\\textbf{Type}   & \\textbf{Approach}   \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textsf{Lecture}  & Prior to the lecture each week, skeleton lecture slides will be posted on vUWS as a PDF file. Spaces will be left in relevant sections of the slides to allow for student annotations. Students can either download the slides and annotate them electronically (e.g. using an appropriate iPad viewer and stylus), or they can print them off and annotate them by hand. \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textsf{Tutorial} & Prior to the tutorial each week, a tutorial worksheet will be posted on vUWS as a PDF file. Students are expected to work through the questions in the worksheets in advance of the tutorial so that they can seek help with those questions and subject areas they find challenging. It is not expected that all of the questions be completed prior to the tutorial but maximum benefit will come to those students who attempt a good proportion of them and seek help from their tutor about any areas of conceptual difficulty they encounter while doing so. \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textsf{vUWS} &  Lecture slides and tutorial sheets will  be  provided  on  vUWS.

      "description": "This level 1 unit develops the quantitative skills that underpin many fields of study in the sciences. The content covered includes basic algebra, functions, graphs, equations, linear and quadratic, introductory probability and descriptive statistics. These mathematical/statistical concepts will be revised and developed using scientific concepts such as molarity and dilution, optical density, population growth, and predator-prey models. In all aspects of this unit, students will be developing and using critical thinking skills to solve mathematical/statistical problems set in a scientific context.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Basic competence in algebraic manipulation and some familiarity with elementary probability and statistical concepts.",
      "approachToLearning": "<p>This unit has been developed to provide many opportunities for students to gain confidence (and knowledge) in their pursuit of the study of mathematics. You will gain this confidence and knowledge by attending all lectures, tutorials and computer lab sessions where various techniques and strategies will be discussed and where the mathematical content will be presented. In these face-to-face sessions, you will have the opportunity to learn new skills, revisit already learned skills and to practice both. You will then apply these skills to solve scientific problems, and conversely, you will be able to take a scientific problem and ‘extract’ the mathematics from it. You will receive feedback on your progress in the face-to-face sessions, and also via your responses to the online activities in the computer lab sessions. Feedback plays a critical role in assessing your progress so you are strongly encouraged to participate in all activities and to make one-on-one appointments throughout the session with your lecturer and/or tutor, to monitor your progress.\n\nIn addition, this unit will emphasize the following areas that will help you meet the challenges that studying mathematics at university presents: identifying your particular learning style and the study strategies that complement your style; enhancing your knowledge of mathematical concepts while building your confidence in your own mathematical ability.\n\nHowever, you will achieve the maximum benefit from this unit only if you put these strategies into practice IN YOUR OWN TIME, out of class. This may mean ch<latex></latex>anging your long-held attitudes/beliefs towards study and mathematics in general.\n\nYou will also find that this unit is linked to the content and learning activities of the other first year units that you could be studying. This relationship further emphasises the importance and relevance of mathematics in the study of science.\n\n</p><p>There is no easy way to learn any mathematics, but an analogy with a sport like tennis holds: it looks easy when you see someone else do it, but doing it one’s self requires hours of practice. Read the definitions, look at examples in the book and in class, and then try doing it yourself, and keep trying until you can do it alone. Do tutorial problems, practice and then practice some more.\n\nLectures are available online and can be viewed at any time. The lecture notes also provide problems. Work through them rather than just reading the solutions. You will learn so much more by doing rather than just watching or reading solutions. You will get stuck; but in the struggle to understand and solve you will begin to master the material.\n\nHistorically this unit has quite a high failure rate each semester; and this is largely due to lack of student engagement. If you do not wish to be one of these students, you are strongly encouraged to work hard at this unit. Attend all scheduled classes; work on the tutorial questions both in and out of class time; and utilise not only sample assessments and past papers but also tutorial problems and examples from lectures to study for all your assessments. </p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\">If you ﬁnd you are struggling, you should also make use of all the free support services: PASS (Peer Assistance Study Scheme), MESH (Mathematics Education Support Hub) or you are also encouraged to seek help from your unit coordinator and/or the teaching staff during their consultation times. MESH provides free drop-in Maths &amp; Stats Help (for locations and times http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/meshroving), plus online help ``I Don't Get It'' (in the Improve Your Maths vUWS site) and unit specific test and exam preparation workshops (http://www.westernsydney.edu.au/mesh_events).</p><p><b>Lectures:</b>\nLectures are a two (2) hour class each week where information on each topic will be presented. Theory and examples will also be presented. Students are welcomed to ask questions as this often avoids misunderstanding. Lecture notes will be available from vUWS and students are expected to have read these notes at least once before the lecture.\n\n</p><p><b>Tutorial:</b>\nThere is a one (1) hour tutorial class each week where students have the opportunity to consolidate their understanding of the previous weeks lecture material. To pass this unit students should attend at least 80% of the tutorial sessions. Tutorial problems will be set each week and students will need to attempt to solve each of these problems before the tutorial class. This may require re-reading lecture notes or textbook, and/or looking at examples provided in lectures and textbook. Students are expected to work individually but discussion with fellow students is encouraged. By completing these tutorial questions you are preparing for the tutorial quizzes, the class test and the final examination. In the tutorial class students may seek further guidance on understanding the theory and/or have solution to problems fully explained.\n\nThere will only be sufficient time to solve a few tutorial problems during the tutorial class, so preparation is essential if tutorials are going to be used effectively. The danger is time could be wasted going over problems that students would have been able to solve on their own if they had done the required preparation, leaving no time for more difficult  problems.\n\n</p><p><b>Practical:</b>\nThere is a one (1) hour computer practical class each week where students have the opportunity to consolidate their understanding of the previous weeks lecture material. A Practice Computer Practical Quiz will be set each week which will prepare students for the next week's Computer Practical Quiz. These quizzes make up 10% of the assessment for this unit.\n\n</p><p><b>vUWS:</b>\nThe following learning resources will be provided on vUWS for the unit:\n\nLecture notes:\nLecture notes with the worked examples omitted will be posted before each lecture, so that you don't have to copy down everything during the lectures and can focus on listening instead. You should print out these notes, bring them to the lecture, and fill in the examples during the lecture.\n\nTutorial exercises and worked solutions to these:\nA sheet with tutorial questions will be posted one week before each tutorial. You should work through these questions before the tutorial and in the tutorial raise any problems you may have had. Complete worked solutions for all tutorial questions will be posted after each tutorial. Doing the tutorial questions and checking your own work against the worked solutions is the best way of preparing for Class Tests and for the Final Exam.\n\nWorked solutions to Class Tests:\nComplete worked solutions for Class Tests will be posted after each Class Test.\n\nA sample final exam paper will be posted before Stuvac. The main purpose of this paper is to give you a rough idea of the style of the questions which you should expect in the exam. The selection of sample questions should not be taken as a hint regarding the actual content of the exam. Do not base your exam preparation primarily on this (or any other) sample exam paper. Merely being able to reproduce solutions to sample exam questions will not be sufficient to pass the Final Exam.</p>",

      "description": "The core strength of this unit, as the advanced version of 300144 Object Oriented Analysis, is to analyse and model business objectives and critical requirements of software systems to be developed using object-oriented (OO) approaches. The system analysis is taken to greater depths within the context of Object Orientation. The Unified Modelling Language version 2.0 (notably use cases, user case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams and sequence diagrams) is used as the modelling standard for creating OO models in the problem, solution and background modeling spaces. The unit also covers the rational unified process methodology and applications of design patterns for software development through real world case studies.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "General understanding of what an information system is and how information systems development is undertaken and\n•\tIntroductory knowledge about system analysis and design, including \n- basic problem solving experience in computerised information systems\n- ability to derive systems requirements from problem definitions\n- ability to produce system models using process, data, object and network modelling.\n- understanding design and implementation issues include, (but may not be limited to), elementary database design, input, output and user interface design and prototyping.\n•\tGeneral knowledge on programming languages\n- Understanding difference between procedure programming  and object oriented programming   \n- Introductory knowledge of classes and objects and class construction\n- Introductory knowledge on object orientation, including encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit is a 10 credit point unit (so needs averagely 10-hour studying time per week) and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. We will provide lecture notes, tutorials and reading materials to support the unit content so that you can practice further in your own time.\n\nAttendance at the tutorials/practicals (face-to-face activities) is compulsory. The mark of each tutorial/practical exercise can only be achieved through attending the session. It is strongly suggested that students start to work on the practical exercises before each class as two hours are usually not enough for completing all the exercises. Attendance at the lectures (face-to-face activities) is highly desirable as it will reflect student’s performance and understanding. Students should go through the lecture notes thoroughly before attending the lecture.\n\nStudents need attempt all unit contents (lecture notes and tutorial exercises) labelled as optional.\n\nStudents should access vUWS and check their student email account(s) at least  three times per week for announcements, teaching materials, recommended readings, documents and other relevant information.",

However, the study of HCI is often restricted to its use as a tool in the software development process. This advanced unit also examines HCI as a field of research and how to conduct research into human user factors. Students in this advanced unit will be required to complete a research project and produce a final research report, which is of a standard capable of being considered for publication in a HCI conference or journal.",

State of the art and advanced concepts will be dealt with in the lectures.<br>2- Practicals: The practicals during the semester are scheduled on a weekly basis (students are encouraged to attend all practicals). The practicals will build on the knowledge learned in the lectures as well as devoting effort to the project development in close consultation with the tutor.<br>3- vUWS: Various supplementary materials will be provided on vUWS including reading material, video snippets, assessment templates, exemplars, FAQ’s, etc. All these materials will be made available in a learning planner module.\n",

      "description": "This unit teaches state-of-the-art web frameworks for developing complex web systems. This unit utilises the skills of basic web programming, database design, and systems analysis that students have learnt in previous units. Major topics in this unit include Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) framework, Razor pages, Model-View-Controller (MVC) programming, object to relational database mapping, and authentication and authorization. Moreover, this unit trains students' collaborative skills by asking students to build a complex website in a small team. As an advanced unit, deeper topics such as custom data validation and error handling will be discussed.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "- Fundamental web development skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.\n- Principles of relational database design and development, practical skills in SQL.\n- Principles of systems analysis and design including the specification of end-user requirements and a good knowledge of the SDLC and its application to solving computer system related problems.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit involves face-to-face lectures and practical classes. The recommended approaches to these activities are given below. \n\nLectures: Lectures aim to explain and demonstrate knowledge and skills in ASP.NET Core programming. Lectures cover or provide references to everything needed in completing practical sets and unit project, so students are strongly encouraged to attend lectures.\n\nPractical classes: Practical classes allow students to put their learning into practice by doing practical programming exercises. Tutors are available in practical classes to help students. To gain full benefit of the practical classes, students should study the lecture materials thoroughly and attempt the practical assignments prior to the classes and then seek help from tutors. It will be impossible for students to complete the practical assignments without prior preparation.\n\nvUWS: Lecture materials (slides and sample codes) and assignment specifications will be made available on vUWS. Also, unit announcements are posted on vUWS regularly. Moreover, practical assignments are submitted via vUWS. Therefore, students are expected to visit vUWS at least three times a week.",

      "description": "This unit is intended as a second unit of study in programming. It builds on a basic understanding of procedural programming as would be developed in a first unit. This unit continues the development of programming skills and methodologies required for professional programming and for further study in later computing units. Topics covered include multi-dimensional arrays, file I/O, searching and sorting, and an introduction to object-oriented programming involving classes and inheritance. Students in this advanced unit will also investigate and apply advanced concepts such as function overloading and recursion.",

      "approachToLearning": "It is important that students engage in, and take responsibility for, their learning. However, there are a number of useful learning aides that are available in this unit to help students succeed. These include, but are not limited to, Lectures, Practical classes, MyProgrammingLab, and Assessments. You may find any number of them useful during the semester.\n <latex>\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Assessments}\n\\\\\nThe assessments in this unit are sets of practical exercises (Practical Sets), a Programming Project, and a Practical Programming Test.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA selection of the weekly practical exercises will be assessable. These exercises are assessable to encourage students to develop their problem solving and programming skills throughout the entire semester rather than just prior to a major assessment falling due; this cannot be emphasised enough since development of good programming skills needs regular practice. Practical exercises are an important aspect of the learning and assessment in this unit since they provide the necessary building blocks of practical programming skills. Students will develop these skills by completing two sets of practical exercises during the semester. As part of the development of the solutions to these practical exercises students will be required to briefly demonstrate their practical exercises to their tutor in class one (1) week before the assessment is due; this is known as a checkpoint; checkpoints are explained in detail in section 2.5.1 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe problem solving and programming skills obtained through lectures, tutorial and practical exercises, use of MyProgrammingLab and appropriate reading will be expanded and applied to a more in-depth programming project that is due toward the end of semester. Hence, it is important that students apply themselves to the smaller practical exercises to be able to pick up the skills needed to solve this more complex problem. More details on the programming project are found in section 2.5.2 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nBeing a very practically oriented unit there is no final written examination at the end of session. Instead, one partial-open-book practical programming test will be run during session that will assess various problem solving and programming skills in a controlled invigilated environment. More details on the practical programming test are found in section 2.5.3 of this learning guide.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{MyProgrammingLab}\n\\\\\nMyProgrammingLab is a website provided by the publisher of the textbook. The website contains extra exercises relating to each of the textbook chapters and is of particular use for students that need extra drill exercises to aid their understanding. The UI of the website enables students to solve simple programming tasks online without the need for a compiler and will provide immediate personalised feedback on each exercise attempted. Details about how to register in MyProgrammingLab will be provided in a separate document at the start of semester in vUWS (Registration will only be possible if you have a valid access code which comes with the textbook Value Pack or may be purchased separately). \n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{Note:} the use of MyProgrammingLab is not a requirement of any of the assessments of this unit and so its use is purely optional but may benefit some students to assist their learning through further exposure to programming problems.\n</latex>",

      "description": "This unit covers the principles, methodologies and technologies for the database design and development, exploring in particular the data modelling methods and the use of the language SQL for the database applications. The unit also examines a number of important database concepts such as database administration, concurrency, backup and recovery, and security. Students in this advanced unit are furthermore required to investigate new technological and theory advances in the database industry and apply them to the solution of concrete database problems.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Basic programming skills, including variable declaration, variable assignment, selection statement and loop structure.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit enhances learning through the following means:\n\nLectures - all regular lecture notes are available on the unit website.  They contain the main points and key issues for the unit, and indicate the depth of understanding expected of the students.  As such, lecturers may choose to elaborate more on certain more important or fundamental concepts or  techniques  during  the  class  and  leave  the  uncovered  slides  to  be  studied  by  the  students themselves.  Some  lectures  will  also  contain  a  few  slides  at  the  end  on  the  SQL  statements  for the  completeness  of  the  notes;  they  are  in  general  expected  to  be  read  by  the  students  again, and briefly explained by the tutors during the tutorials/practicals on the need-to basis.\n\nTutorials/Practicals  -  provide  students  with  hands-on  experience  working  with  database  design and construction as well as effectively formulating queries in SQL. The tutorial part will discuss with the students some selected topics in more detail.  The combination of tutorials and practicals will  typically  consolidate  what  the  students  have  already  learned  in  the  previous  week/s,  with possibly  some  relevant  additional  materials  as  well,  and  will  provide  feedback  immediately  in class and in person whenever possible so that students are aware of their level of understanding of the material being presented.\n\nAssignments - two assignments are set to go through the main aspects of database design and development. The design process entailed by these assignments will go a long way at enhancing the students' profound understanding on the design and the use of database. Making queries in SQL is another skill to be gained by the students through these assignments. Assignments will also contain advanced content not covered in the lectures or practicals.\n\nTextbook - the text provides additional detail and examples on top of what is in the lecture notes. Students should refer to it if in difficulty with a concept or technique, and should try to read through the relevant parts as much as possible.\n\nAdvanced Content - There are a variety of slides or practical paragraphs marked explicitly as advanced or optional: they are optional only to the students of the sister unit 300104. Students in 300941 should still study these materials even though they are marked advanced or optional.\n\nvUWS and External Portal - all announcements and teaching materials, including all assignments, are accessible via vUWS, as well as the External Portal outside vUWS. All submissions must be electronic and through the submission page at the unit website. Students are required to visit the unit website for the latest announcement on a regular basis.\n\nUnit 300941 will share the website with the unit 300104 - Database Design and Development.\n\n",

Microsoft Access will also be briefly utilised in the practicals. The unit learning outcomes are summarised in the table at the end of this subsection.\n\nThis unit promotes teamwork - the two major assignments can be done in a group two. \n\nThere are no prerequisites for this unit. However, basic programming skills, including variable declaration, variable assignment, selection statement and loop structure, are the assumed knowledge.\n\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Describe components of a database system, advantages and disadvantages of a database system, roles peoples play and the historical development of a database system in the context of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)\n2. Apply basic skills in database modeling, including ER diagrams and normalization in RDBMS\n3. Explain the basic concepts of relational algebra and apply them in queries\n4. Describe the general concepts of transaction management\n5. Identify concepts in database administration\n6. Describe concepts in database security and backup\n7. Define and manipulate data using structured query language (SQL)\n8. Design and develop a database for a business application using a commercial database management system\n9. Investigate and apply advanced database techniques such as higher normal forms, stored procedures, triggers, indexes and limited data denormalization",

      "description": "This unit is designed to provide the student with the knowledge necessary to understand the information contained in the health record, to function in a medical environment through an understanding of the fundamentals of medicine and to effectively use disease classification systems. Within each body system, the student will study anatomy and physiology, disease processes and their treatment, and medical terminology (disease titles, symptomatic terms, surgical terms and investigations). The unit will also focus on specialist topics such as mental health, obstetrics, paediatrics, infectious diseases, oncology, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, diagnostic and surgical interventions.",

There are many resources available to assist you in this unit and university study more generally. The key activities and resources for this unit are outlined below.\n\nThis unit will be run simultaneously in Day mode (on-campus classroom delivery) and Composite Mode (mixture of on-campus and online delivery). This means that the same learning materials will be made available to all sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment work tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for all sub-groups.\n\nAll lectures and tutorials in this unit will run simultaneously across all campuses using teleconferencing facilities located in the Access Grid rooms. The same learning materials will be made available to all students at the same time. \n\nBoth Day and Composite mode students are required to attend compulsory assessments in person within their enrolled campus. Composite mode students attend Lectures in weeks 5, 10 and 12 of session in order to perform their compulsory assessments, in addition to their Final Exam on-campus attendance. \n\nLearning materials for this unit will be accessible to enrolled students by login to the WSU online learning site vUWS.  Copies of the lecture slides of the lectures will be posted there, normally before the lecture. Copies of the video/audio recordings of the lectures will also be posted there, normally within 24 hrs of the lecture. Announcements and discussions on this unit will also be placed on the vUWS site from time to time, and you should consult the site often so that you are aware of these. Failure to stay-up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse.\n\nInteraction with the unit coordinator at their scheduled consultation times each week is possible in person or by e-mail, telephone contact, or video-conferencing (by arrangement). Please feel free to contact the unit coordinator at any time, should you be experiencing difficulties, have any queries or comments about this unit.",

The unit will also include the historical development of clinical classification systems as well as the purpose and value of classifying diseases and interventions within the health system. The student will become familiar with the structure and content of ICD-10-AM ACHI/ACS and be introduced to the rules and conventions associated within ICD-10-AM/ACHI. The primary ACS for ICD-10-AM/ACHI will be studied and applied when coding from line diagnoses/interventions, case studies, simple discharge summaries and clinical record reports. They will gain skills in data abstraction for clinical coding, specifically, the selection of principal and additional diagnoses and interventions.",

ICD defines the diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions. ICD coded data allows:<br>- easy computer-based storage, retrieval and analysis of health information for evidence-based decision-making; <br>- sharing and comparing health information between hospitals, regions, settings and countries; and <br>- data comparisons in the same location across different periods. </p>\n<p>ICD-10-AM is the Australian Modification of the international standard, used in Australia. In this unit, students will get an introduction to ICD-10-AM latest edition and associated classification systems. These associated classification systems include ACHI (Australian Classification of Health Interventions) and ACS (Australian Coding Standards). </p>\n<p>As future health informaticians, students must have a sound comprehension of these classification systems. Hence at the successful completion of this unit students can:</p>\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Summarise the history and development of ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS.\n2. Explain the difference between a statistical classification and a nomenclature.\n3. Understand and correctly apply the principles and techniques of clinical classification to code diagnoses and interventions using ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS.\n4. Identify and interpret diagnostic and therapeutic test results and accurately classify findings based on qualification from within the clinical record.\n5. Analyse diagnostic and procedural statements, case studies and simple discharge summaries/clinical record reports to determine which clinical statements to abstract and classify.\n6. Source further information to clarify complex clinical coding issues.\n7. Explain the use of clinical classification systems in health care, describing their purpose and value.\n8.

Mortality or cause of death coding will also be examined.Concepts of organising health information in a logical way to interface with an electronic information system will be investigated. The design and role of various health classification systems including the World Health Organizations Family of International Classifications (WHO FIC), specifically ICD 11 and casemix classification systems (e.g. AR DRGs, AN SNAP) will also be discussed. The practical component of this unit will focus on the student further developing their classification skills in the more complex areas of clinical coding including endocrine disorders, specifically diabetes mellitus, circulatory diseases and interventions, genitourinary disorders, specifically chronic kidney disease, obstetrics, paediatrics and congenital anomalies and trauma and procedural complications. The ACS will be applied in detail when classifying from complex discharge summaries and full clinical episodes of care. The student will also be exposed to electronic clinical coding tools that can be used in the classification process.",

      "description": "This unit will introduce students to Activity Based Funding and Casemix within the Australian healthcare system. It is designed to cover a variety of casemix classification systems for acute, non-admitted, sub-acute and mental health patients. Attention will be given to Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) with specific reference to the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-DRGs) and the relationship to Activity Based Funding and purchasing models. Measuring performance with activity data and clinical costing methods will be explored. Emphasis will be placed on the impact of data quality as a critical component in achieving excellence in clinical costing, casemix and patient safety.",

There are many resources available to assist you in this unit and university study more generally. The key activities and resources for this unit are outlined below. Learning materials for all the units will be accessible to enrolled students by login to the WSU online learning site ‘vUWS’. Copies of the lecture slides and audio/video recordings of the lectures will also be posted there, normally within 24 hrs of the lecture. Announcements and discussions on the units will also be placed on the vUWS site from time to time, and you should consult the site often so that you are aware of these. Failure to stay up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse.\n\nInteraction with the unit coordinator at their scheduled consultation times each week is possible for online mode students in person or by e-mail, telephone contact, or skype (by arrangement).\n\nOnline Students\nAll information and material relating to this unit will be available on vUWS. This unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and online. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to all sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment work tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for all sub-groups. \n\nOnline mode students will be required to take any final exam scheduled in a unit at the same time as the on-campus mode students. Arrangements for online mode students to write final exams in these units will be announced close to the end of the semester after the official exam schedule becomes available.\n\nPlease feel free to contact the unit coordinator at any time, should you be experiencing difficulties or have any queries or comments about any unit: we would like to offer you any extra support necessary as an online mode student.",

      "description": "This unit extends the student’s knowledge of Health Informatics by introducing concepts relating to electronic communications within the health industry. It exposes students to a variety of environments used to create, store, transfer and deliver healthcare data. Areas include minimum data sets, data linkage, messaging concepts/standards, terminologies, healthcare evaluation, electronic health records and related standards, security, privacy and trust, medico legal, epidemiology and population health together with TeleHealth/ TeleMedicine approaches, methodologies, tools and techniques.",

      "approachToLearning": "Lecture:\nLectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Each lecture will set the context for the tutorial to follow and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination. Attendance in lectures is strongly recommended, and all content covered in lectures is examinable. All lectures will be recorded and made available on vUWS.\n\nTutorial:\nTutorials provide the opportunity for reinforcing and extending your learning in a more hands-on and interactive setting. The tutorial is designed for further discussion of the theoretical aspects of the unit, discussion and exploration of the practical concepts involved in health informatics, as well as familiarisation with and practice in the use of websites and online tools. Along with your lectures, tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the final exam, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. Tutorials also give you the opportunity to discuss your assignment progress and understanding of the unit content with your lecturers.\n\ne-Learning: vUWS\nTo support your learning in this unit, you will have access to the units site on the university's e-learning system, vUWS. On the vUWS site students will get access to: weekly schedule, teaching materials for each module (lecture notes and tutorial exercises), recordings of the lecture/tutorial sessions (normally within 1-2 days after the session), details of assessments and any unit announcements.\nThe unit coordinator will use vUWS announcements as the main communication channel to send messages to students, and should be checked for updates at least twice a week.  Failure to stay-up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse.\n\nNOTES FOR EXTERNAL/ONLINE STUDENTS \nThis unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and external/online mode. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to both sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for both sub-groups. \nExternal/online students can join the live lecture/tutorial sessions via the Zoom session by following the instructions given on the vUWS site.",

This unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and online. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to all sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment work tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for all sub-groups. \n\nLearning materials for all the units will be accessible to enrolled students by login to the WSU online learning site ‘vUWS”. Copies of the lecture slides and video/audio recordings of the lectures will also be posted there, normally within 24 hrs of the lecture. Announcements and discussions on the units will also be placed on the vUWS site from time to time, and you should consult the site often so that you are aware of these. Failure to stay-up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse. \n\nInteraction with the unit coordinator at their scheduled consultation times each week is possible for all students in person. A 1-hour weekly tutorial session will be delivered for both online and campus delivery students via an online ‘chat-style’ platform which will provide the opportunity for students to interact with the tutor as well as ask any questions on unit subject matter.",

Whilst this has interest on a personal level, the killer-apps will be in analyzing such data for business; tracking the buzz around a new product, understanding the links between customers etc. This unit will introduce its students to the Social Web data that is available, and blend computational, mathematical and statistical concepts to allow extraction and analysis of such data.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students are expected to be familiar with fundamental computer programming concepts.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit will be offered on the Parramatta, Kingswood and Campbelltown campuses over a thirteen week period. Each week will consist of a two hour lecture and a two hour computer lab class.\n\nThe assessments will consist of weekly online quizzes, of which the best 5 marks are counted, a group project, and a final examination. The assessment items during the semester are designed to gauge your achievement and performance in relation to the unit learning outcomes; they are also an excellent preparation for the final examination, which is a summative examination with a threshold requirement. Students are encouraged to study learning materials weekly, since later topics are related to the early topics. It may be difficult to understand latter topics without understanding the former topics.\n\nAll teaching materials will be released on vUWS as the semester progresses. Moreover, all lectures will be recorded and uploaded to vUWS. – Please note that these online resources are meant to aid revision; they are NOT MEANT TO, AND CANNOT, REPLACE FACE TO FACE TIME during the weekly lectures and computer lab classes. Active participation in lectures and labs is crucial for mastering the learning outcomes: Records from previous years show that poor attendance in lectures and labs is highly correlated with failing the unit. The members of the teaching team are there to help you achieve the learning outcomes and succeed in this unit, but you need to make use of this offer. \n\nLectures \nData Analysis is based on understanding the logic behind the techniques which requires understanding mathematics/statistics. While this unit is too short to give all theoretical explanations of the techniques you will see, it is crucial that you know how a statistical method works; only then can you decide whether it is applicable to a situation in which you’re interested. The objective of the lecture is to explain both how a statistical technique works and how to apply it.\n\nComputer Labs\nUnderstanding how a method works is the first step; being able to apply it in practice is the second. These computer lab classes will give you the opportunity to use theory in practice: We use the powerful open source statistics software R for teaching; it is a standard for professional statisticians all over the world. Students are encouraged to spend time with R in their own time, since they are assumed to have a basic understanding in R programming language, and expected to excel their programming skills as the semester progresses.",

      "description": "Rapid growth of computational devices connected to the internet such as mobile phones, tablets, personal computers have made us into a digitally connected society. This has enabled us to develop a new computing paradigm: Social Computing to enhance ways we can fulfil a range of primary and secondary human needs. Already many new businesses have evolved making use of these possibilities surpassing the number of users in corresponding conventional businesses such as retail, transportation and hotel chains. In this unit you will learn the fundamental concepts of Social Computing, how Social Computing is evolving, explore interaction models of social networks, analyse a few reported cases that relate to social computing in detail to understand the impact on society and businesses, and explore ways to enhance a range of livelihood activities and future possibilities. This unit will also cover underpinning technologies related to social computing such as Web 2.0, knowledge management and related security and privacy issues.",
      "assumedKnowledge": null,
      "approachToLearning": "This unit is delivered as a two-hour workshop once a week throughout the semester. In the workshops, we explore and discuss issues related to the topic for that week. Students need to explore these further during the week and on 3 occasions write a Blog reflecting on what they have learned. Students further explore the essential social computing concepts that they have learned by working on a group project to enhance an existing social scenario using Social Computing paradigm and presenting it to the class. This activity is aimed at fostering both analysis and synthesis skills.\n\nStudents as part of the assessment activities need to write reports reflecting on what has been learned to enhance deep learning.\n\nThis unit is delivered using a blended learning approach. During the workshops, students will be involved in individual and group-based brainstorming sessions using “GoSoapbox” and during class discussion, they can get feedback to shape their individual understanding. Students experience digital modes of communication and interactions through writing Blogs, responding to comments and also creating a Wiki as part of their project work. Students can consult with academics both face to face and using applications such as Skype or Zoom.\n",

Describe characteristics of Social Computing and explain these characteristics using examples\n3. Describe the factors and technologies that enabled wide spread use of social computing\n4. Analyse a specific scenario related to lack of timely information leading to unsatisfactory outcomes and develop a solution based on a Social Computing paradigm to transform these scenarios\n5. Explain the rapid evolution of Social Computing using theories relevant to technology diffusion\n6. Synthesise the future impact on Social Computing on individuals, organisations and the society as a whole",

      "description": "Across the world and across history, humans have wondered about the universe, its history and evolution.  From the Big Bang to the end of the Universe, from our own Solar System to the farthest superclusters of galaxies, our knowledge and understanding of the Universe in which we live is growing at an amazing rate. In this unit, we survey the cosmos from two different perspectives relating to complexity: The perspectives of Information and Life. From the information perspective, we examine the growth of complexity and structure in the universe, and consider the uses of information theory to understand cosmic evolution. We know that Life exists in the Universe, but know little about how common it might be - we consider the requirements for life to exist and the possibility of other life in the Universe by examining the cosmos at scales from planets to the universe. We consider cultural perspectives on the cosmos, including that of indigenous Australians. This unit is non-technical and is suitable as an introductory unit for students in computing, engineering and science, and as a general education unit for students in all other areas.",

It exposes students to a variety of environments used to create, store, transfer and deliver healthcare data. Areas include minimum data sets, data linkage, messaging concepts/standards, terminologies, healthcare evaluation, electronic health records and related standards, security, privacy and trust, medico legal, epidemiology and population health together with TeleHealth/TeleMedicine approaches, methodologies, tools and techniques. Advanced skills and knowledge on researching into recent developments in specific sub-topics will be acquired through assessment components in the unit.",

      "approachToLearning": "Lecture:\nLectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Each lecture will set the context for the tutorial to follow and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination. Attendance in lectures is strongly recommended, and all content covered in lectures is examinable. All lectures will be recorded and made available on vUWS.\n\nTutorial:\nTutorials provide the opportunity for reinforcing and extending your learning in a more hands-on and interactive set-ting. The tutorial is designed for further discussion of the theoretical aspects of the unit, discussion and exploration of the practical concepts involved in health informatics, as well as familiarisation with and practice in the use of websites and online tools. Along with your lectures, tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the ﬁnal exam, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. Tutorials also give you the opportunity to discuss your assignment progress and understanding of the unit content with your lecturers.\n\neLearning: vUWS\nTo support your learning in this unit, you will have access to the units site on the university’s e-learning system, vUWS. On the vUWS site students will get access to: weekly schedule, teaching materials for each module (lecture notes and tutorial exercises), recordings of the lecture/tutorial sessions (normally within 1-2 days after the session), details of assessments and any unit announcements.\nThe unit coordinator will use vUWS announcements as the main communication channel to send messages to students, and should be checked for updates at least twice a week. Failure to stay-up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse.\n\nNOTES FOR EXTERNAL/ONLINE STUDENTS\nThis unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and external/online mode. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to both sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for both sub-groups.\nExternal/online students can join the live lecture/tutorial sessions via the Zoom session by following the instructions given on the vUWS site.",

Services Computing technology includes Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA), business consulting methodology and utilities, business process modelling, transformation and integration. Students will learn, through the development of practical examples, how to utilise these technologies within a healthcare context. Advanced knowledge and knowledge of recent developments in specific sub-topics will also be acquired through practical components in the unit.",

This unit will be run simultaneously in on-campus classroom delivery mode (internal students) and online. This means that the same learning materials will be made available to all sub-groups of students at the same time. Also, any within-semester continuous assessment work tasks will be identical and due for submission at the same time and by the same method, for all sub-groups. \n\nLearning materials for all the units will be accessible to enrolled students by login to the WSU online learning site ‘vUWS”. Copies of the lecture slides and video/audio recordings of the lectures will also be posted there, normally within 24 hrs of the lecture. Announcements and discussions on the units will also be placed on the vUWS site from time to time, and you should consult the site often so that you are aware of these. Failure to stay-up-to-date with information on vUWS will not be accepted as an excuse. \n\nInteraction with the unit coordinator at their scheduled consultation times each week is possible for all students in person. A 1-hour weekly tutorial session will be delivered for both online and campus delivery students via an online ‘chat-style’ platform which will provide the opportunity for students to interact with the tutor as well as ask any questions on unit subject matter.",

The mathematical background that is needed to follow the unit is fairly minimal. No programming background is required. The unit is suitable for Level 2 students and is suitable for students in Mathematics pathways as well as students in Computer Science, Engineering or Finance pathways. Students from other pathways (e.g., Business) will be most welcome.\n\nA broad outcome of the course is to promote understanding Mathematics by using computers to explore, investigate and experiment, and consequently arriving at scientific conclusions. In details, upon successfully completing this unit, students will be able to:\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Compute complex numerical expressions by utilising the computational software Mathematica\n2. Handle symbolic computations\n3. Combine different styles of programming (functional, procedural and list-based) to write powerful programs\n4. Analyse, investigate, gain insight and intuition and then solve real-world mathematical problems by using Mathematica symbolic computational feature\n5. Create complex graphics and solving equations by combining Mathematica graphics capabilities",

As such, it is critical that students work consistently on this unit throughout the semester. Through the exams, it is intended to examine a student's understanding and ability to apply appropriate techniques rather than the ability to rote learn.\n\nLecture - Lectures are a two (2) hour class where information on each topic will be presented. Examples will also be presented. Lectures notes will be available from vUWS and students are expected to have read these notes at least once before the lecture. These lecture notes should be printed and brought to the lecture. Students should also bring the recommended text book to the lecture.\n\nPractical - The first hour of the practical will be used for discussion and answering selected questions from the previous week's topic which are to be completed before the practical each week. This is a chance for students to discuss any problems or concerns with the material presented in the previous lecture. The second hour students will learn how to complete questions from the previous week's topic using the statistical software R. Each week there will questions to be completed in R. One question will be presented by the lecturer explaining how to complete the question in R. The students will then attempt another similar question which will be checked. There is no practical in the first week.",

      "approachToLearning": "The lecture will be offered simultaneously in Parramatta and Campbelltown (via access grid). The practicals will be two hours in Parramatta and Campbelltown (separately), in a computer lab.\nThe idea for the lecture is to provide the necessary background to understand the techniques that we apply in the practicals. Even though it is (at times) possible to apply the techniques without understanding what is going on \"behind the scenes\", this understanding is necessary to realise in which cases we can expect a particular technique to work (it will also be necessary to understand what is going on to pass the exam). \n\nAs most of the assessments (including the quizzes and the exams) are fairly practical, it is helpful to repeat and practice the lessons learned each week - this will help you to become confident (and quicker) with some of the simple problems, and leave you with more time to think about the actual problems that you are meant to solve in the assessments. \n\nThe access grid delivery and availability of teaching materials on vUWS appear to tempt some students to not attend the lecture. From experience, poor attendance is correlated with poor marks and failing the unit. The material on vUWS is meant to help you revise what you have heard in class. Just attending class and the practicals will usually not be sufficient to achieve good marks - you will need to spend additional time practicing every week outside the lecture and practical times. ",

This unit first covers the programming fundamentals on data types, conditional selections and loop structures, and then further develops the problem solving skills through the use of user-defined functions, records, files, as well as the basic concept and techniques of object-oriented programming. A high level programming language is employed to implement all the problem solutions.",

They contain the main points and key issues for the unit, and indicate the depth of understanding expected of the students. As such, the lecturer may choose to elaborate more on certain more important or fundamental concepts or techniques during the class and leave the uncovered slides to be studied by the students themselves.\n\n</p>\n<p>Tutorial Practicals - provide students with the hands-on experience on the Java programming. These programming exercises will typically consolidate what the students have already learned in the current and previous week/s, with possibly some relevant additional materials as well. The instructor will also provide feedback immediately in class and in person whenever possible so that students are aware of their level of understanding as well as their progress on the unit as a whole.</p>",

The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Whilst attendance in lectures is not compulsory, it is highly recommended. All content covered in lectures is examinable. The lecture sets the context for the practical the following week and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final quiz.\n\n+Tutorial: Practicals/tutorials provide the opportunity for learning in a smaller class context. The practicals/tutorials are designed for further discussion of the theoretical concepts covered in lectures, as well as exploration of the practical concepts and samples involved in developing mobile applications with Android Java and Xcode Swift, including working on practical exercises and assignments. Along with your lectures, the practicals/tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the final quiz, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. The practicals/tutorials enables students to maintain adequate performance and continuity of their tutorial/practical program and tutors to maintain contact, monitor their students progress as well as provide verbal feedback of your work and understanding outside of formal assignment feedback.\n\n+ vUWS: Students should access vUWS and/or check their student email account(s) at least twice a week for teaching materials, announcements and reading materials, documents and other information.",

      "approachToLearning": "<p>This unit is a 10 credit point unit and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. It is expected that you will spend at least 10 hours each week (on average) which includes face-to-face (lectures and tutorials/practicals) and self study (reading online materials and teaching materials, and completing assessment tasks). Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less. Lectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Whilst attendance in lectures is not compulsory, it is highly recommended. All content covered in lectures is examinable. The lecture sets the context for the practical the following week and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination. Practicals/tutorials provide the opportunity for learning in a smaller class context. The practicals/tutorials are designed for further discussion of the theoretical concepts covered in lectures, as well as exploration of the practical concepts and samples involved in developing programs for computer graphics. Along with your lectures, the practicals/tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the quiz, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. The practicals/tutorials enables students to maintain adequate performance and continuity of their tutorial/practical program and tutors to maintain contact, monitor their students progress as well as provide verbal feedback of your work and understanding outside of formal assignment feedback. Students should access vUWS and/or check their student email account(s) at least twice a week for teaching materials, announcements and reading materials, documents and other information.</p>",

It covers the major concepts of information visualisation, human-computer perception and methods for visual data analysis. Students will learn the knowledge and skills required for identifying suitable visualisation techniques and tools appropriate for various data types and applications. The unit provides students with opportunities to explore recent research in the visualisation field.",

      "approachToLearning": "This unit is a 10 credit point unit and will require your full and continuous attention to maintain the highest possible grades. It is expected that you will spend at least 10 hours each week (on average) which includes \nface-to-face (lectures and tutorials/practicals) and self study (reading online materials and teaching materials, and completing assessment tasks). Some weeks you will spend more time on learning activities and assessments and in other weeks the workload will be somewhat less.\n\nLectures are a key element of your learning environment in this unit. The lectures will focus on familiarising the students with the theoretical concepts of the unit content. Whilst attendance in lectures is not compulsory, it is highly recommended. All content covered in lectures is examinable. The lecture sets the context for the practical the following week and will highlight concepts and skills you will need for the formal final examination.\n\nPracticals/tutorials provide the opportunity for learning in a smaller class context. The practicals/tutorials are designed for further discussion of the theoretical concepts covered in lectures, as well as exploration of the practical concepts and samples involved in developing programs for computer graphics. Along with your lectures, the practicals/tutorials are designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills that will form the basis upon which you will be assessed in the quiz, as well as give you the knowledge and skills required to complete the assignments. The practicals/tutorials enables students to maintain adequate performance and continuity of their tutorial/practical program and tutors to maintain contact, monitor their students progress as well as provide verbal feedback of your work and understanding outside of formal assignment\nfeedback.\n\nStudents should access vUWS and/or check their student email account(s) at least twice a week for teaching materials, announcements and reading materials, documents and other information.",

The aims are to identify properties of social networks, and to make predictions about future events. Topics included will cover areas such as Graph theory, Game theory and Network dynamics and we will identify how these can be used to model and extract information from Facebook and Twitter.",

In the lectures we will present the material, while in the lab classes we will be examining the topics and working on activities. Each computer lab class will be split into two sections; in the first we will go through set tutorial questions and in the second, we will work though computational problems. To get most out of this unit, students should attend all lectures and tutorials, and attempt all tutorial and lab questions before the attending the lab classes.",

      "approachToLearning": "The unit consists of lectures (face-to-face), and practical/tutorial sessions.  The lectures cover the essential material of the unit.  In the practical/tutorial sessions the participants learn how to use computer software to apply the methods learnt in lectures.\n\nThe idea for the lecture is to provide the necessary background to understand the techniques that we apply in the practicals. Even though it is (at times) possible to apply the techniques without understanding what is going on \"behind the scenes\", this understanding is necessary to realise in which cases we can expect a particular technique to work (it will also be necessary to understand what is going on to pass the exam).\nAs most of the assessments (including the quizzes and the exams) are fairly practical, it is helpful to repeat and practice the lessons learned each week - this will help you to become confident (and quicker) with some of the simple problems, and leave you with more time to think about the actual problems that you are meant to solve in the assessments.\n\nStudents are required to independently study/practise the lecture material, in addition to attending the lectures and practicals.  It is expected that the total effort required to pass this unit is approximately 10h/week (2h lectures, 2h practical, and 6 hours self-study and assessments). \n\nSome of the lectures will be provided additionally as a recorded lecture on vUWS. Not all lectures will be available this way (and no guarantee will be given for availability of a recording) . Recorded material that we make available is intended for repetition, it is not a replacement of the lecture, and attendance of the lectures and practicals is strongly recommended. From experience, poor attendance is correlated with poor marks and failing the unit. The material on vUWS is meant to help you revise what you have heard in class. Similarly, only attending class and the practicals will usually not be sufficient to achieve good marks or even to pass the unit - you will need to spend additional time practicing every week outside the lecture and practical times.",

Further, it is imperative to be able to think as an experimental scientist, e.g. form testable hypotheses and identify sources of errors. </p>\n<p>In this unit, we delve into the domain of life sciences, relevant technologies, learn how to design and conduct experiments, and use our analytical skills to explore real data. \n\nWe will talk about all kingdoms of life but our experimental focus will be on the microbe communities that are present various environments.</p>\n<p>Our aim is not to teach (or assess) bioinformatics (that would require a dedication of two years) but to further teach you how to study like a data scientist: For example, being able to do, in turn: rapidly acquire knowledge from a new domain, design robust experiments, use these to solve specific problems, consider the consequences of your data collection and experiments, and effectively communicate it to a variable audience.</p>\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Explain what a gene and an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) are and discuss their different aspects (e.g. a physical entity, a statistical data point, a philosophical construct)\n2. Develop an experimental plan for conducting a genomic experiment\n3. Demonstrate proficiency with bioinformatic tools to assign gene function, cluster DNA sequences, visualise and interpret genomic data\n4. Evaluate the results of automated bioinformatic pipelines within a context encompassing human errors, biological data noise and computing limitations\n5. Author a short yet effective online product (blog, podcast, videocast) that explains the rationale and results of the genomic experiment",

In order to develop evidence-based decision-making skills, students will learn how to work with data. Students will organise and summarise data, present data visually and design surveys for new data collection and use. Students will develop skills in understanding decision-making models and forecasting as a means of improving business processes and HR, management and business metrics.",

Students are expected to view each of the sub topic videos for the weekly topic before the weekly tutorial.\n\nThis unit is one in which the later topics build on material covered earlier in the unit. As such, it is critical that students work consistently on this unit throughout the semester. Through the exam, it is intended to examine a student's understanding and ability to apply appropriate techniques rather than the ability to rote learn.",

      "description": "This unit teaches students ethical hacking principles and skills with the ultimate goal of defence. It covers practical skills in different stages of ethical hacking, including reconnaissance on public information, port and vulnerability scanning, exploitation of vulnerabilities, post exploitation, and writing a comprehensive report to document detected vulnerabilities and proposed solutions. Students will not only practice with major tools in ethical hacking, but also learn the principles of how these tools work and hence how to defend against them.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "Students should have a solid understanding on computer networking (especially with the TCP/IP protocol suite), possess basic programming skills in developing computer applications and web applications, and command basic knowledge and skills in databases and operating systems.",
      "approachToLearning": "<p><b>Lectures:</b> Lectures aim to explain and demonstrate knowledge and skills in Ethical Hacking. Lectures cover or provide references to everything needed in tutorials and labs, so students are strongly encouraged to attend lectures.\n</p>\n<p><b>Tutorials/Labs:</b> Each 2-hour tutorial/lab class consists of roughly 0.5-hour tutorial discussion and 1.5-hour lab work. In the tutorial discussion, the tutor will discuss the online quiz questions with you. In the 1.5-hour lab work, you should complete practical exercises according to the lab instructions posted on vUWS. You can get help from tutors during lab work.\nYou should show your lab report to your tutor before the end of the lab. If you cannot finish within the lab, the only chance to be marked is in the next lab class; however, you will receive 50% late penalty for this if no extenuating circumstances are present. To prevent losing marks due to late completion, you should start working on labs before you enter lab classes.\n</p>\n<p><b>vUWS:</b> Unit materials, including lecture slides, online quizzes and lab instructions, will be made available on the unit vUWS site. Also, all unit announcements will be made via vUWS. Therefore, you are expected to visit vUWS at least three times a week.\n</p>",

Enterprise in this context includes small, medium and large organisations operating in diverse sectors (private, NGO, government). Several architectural patterns have emerged to enable responsive, efficient, secure, and reliable enterprise software. This unit provides a deep understanding of these architectural patterns, examining the motivation, strengths, and limitations of different choices. To demonstrate the broader application of the concepts introduced in the unit, a practical case study is deeply examined.",

      "approachToLearning": "In this course, the lectures are delivered online, supported by practical work done in class. Each week, students will learn a different technique from 3D modelling that will help them build increasingly complex 3D models, creating your own modelling portfolio with various 3D models. The learning milestones come every 2-3 weeks, when you are required to present your current results and discuss challenges and achievements with your fellow colleagues. The collaborative nature of this class will help you design and deliver 3D models and beautiful renders of objects and architecture. ",

      "description": "A creative spark or innovative idea is not enough to succeed as a start-up organisation. A new idea behind a product or a service needs to be first verified to understand the business opportunities out there. Then the identified opportunities need to be adjusted to formalise in a business concept. This unit aims to guide students through that process of converting the creative or innovative idea into the development of a product or service as a sound business concept. This objective is driven through teams of students advancing with their practical projects and along the way learning about a number of theoretical topics such as:  prototyping, user testing, etc. The unit will be delivered through a number of modules. As a vital part of the unit, students are expected to engage and work in “start-up co-working space” on a regular basis. At the successful completion of this unit, students would have converted the innovative idea into a business product or service.",

The students will have an opportunity to apply practical concepts and techniques involved in new product planning, development, implementation and control. Besides learning about theory and practice of entrepreneurs, students will engage in active learning by working in cross-functional teams to develop an initial prototype of their product idea.\n\nThe unit specifically focuses on the following - \n-\tInterplay between product, service and system aspects of product design\n-\tDeveloping the product prototype utilising technological skills \n-\tTesting and refinement of a product \n-\tCreative problem-solving in product development \n-\tMarketing material development that promotes the product\n\nFurther, three key components are designed to support the students:\n-\tFace to face contact: weekly four-hour face to face lecture and tutorial per week\n-\tOnline: modules provided via vUWS site\n-\tStudents Working on the prototype\n\nStudents will work on developing their prototypes in the computer labs during the tutorials. The unit’s content provides students with an understanding of the cross-functional activities required to take an idea from the initial planning phase through to early prototyping phase. This unit effectively provides a full introduction to a New Product Development within a startup, however, in practice it is expected that students may only be able to produce an initial prototype.\n\nUnit content includes, but is not limited to:\n-\tProduct planning \n-\tDevelopment processes\n-\tInnovation tools\n-\tProduct specifications\n-\tConcept generation, selection and testing\n-\tProduct architecture\n-\tRobust design\n-\tPrototyping\n-\tGenerating marketing material for product promotion using principles and practices of the innovation process.",

ICD defines the diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions. ICD coded data allows:<br>- easy computer-based storage, retrieval and analysis of health information for evidence-based decision-making;<br>- sharing and comparing health information between hospitals, regions, settings and countries; and<br>- data comparisons in the same location across different periods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">ICD-10-AM is the Australian Modification of the international standard, used in Australia. In this unit, students will get an introduction to ICD-10-AM latest edition and associated classification systems. These associated classification systems include ACHI (Australian Classification of Health Interventions) and ACS (Australian Coding Standards).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As future health informaticians, students must have a sound comprehension of these classification systems. Hence at the successful completion of this unit students can:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"></p>\n\n Outcomes\n\n1. Summarise the history and development of ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS\n2. Analytically represent the difference between a statistical classification and a nomenclature through independent research\n3. Correctly apply the principles and techniques of clinical classification to code diagnoses and interventions using ICD-10-AM/ACHI/ACS\n4.

Students will learn the basic theories and algorithms that are essential in the design and development of intelligent systems. The unit will focus on two typical AI applications: game playing and e-trading. Students will have the chance of using existing multiagent system platforms to design and develop intelligent software for game playing and automated trading in e-markets.",
      "assumedKnowledge": "This unit requires basic skills in programming with either JAVA or C++ as the programming language.",
      "approachToLearning": "This unit enhances learning through lectures, tutorials, assignments, textbook and other online materials.\n\nLectures - explain the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence with selected topics. Lecture notes are available on vUWS. Students are expected to preview associated lecture notes before each lecture and view the lecture notes again after the lecture.\n\nTutorials - provide students with questions and hands-on experience designed to challenge them to think about and feel intelligent systems with detailed instructions or hints. Opportunities are there for students to ask questions and discuss among themselves. Attendance to the tutorials is compulsory.\n\nAssignments - The first assignment will be purely theoretical, which is designed for enhancing a good understanding of the fundamental knowledge of Artificial Intelligence.

Illustrate how drivers written for various robot parts are viewed as nodes and services under the ROS system framework.\n3. Explain how different ‘processes’ made for other applications can be incorporated onto their own software projects under ROS through the use of standard/predefined topics.\n4. Describe how various state-of-the-art AI software can be embedded into a ROS system by having them as a backend for certain ROS processing tasks (nodes).\n5. Develop software for interacting with sensor and controlling actuators using ROS tools.\n6. Develop software using current state-of-the-art AI systems as backend for processes as ROS Nodes.",

This unit provides a foundation in using the Natural Language Toolkit, which is a leading platform for building Python programs working with ‘human language’ data, as well as an introduction to Python for Natural Language Processing. Students will use algorithms and explore accessing text corpora and processing raw text; categorising words and classifying text; understanding information from text and analysing sentence structures; and understanding semantic meanings of sentences. Students also gain real-world hands-on experience with Natural Language Understanding through the practical tasks and assignments.",
